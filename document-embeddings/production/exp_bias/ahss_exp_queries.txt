relation to a more recent postindustrial project by landscape architect gilles clement, derborence island in park henri matisse.\nthe paper concludes by proposing a representational technique using physical models, of salt crystallization, sand dispersal, sedimentation, and water flow, that too make entropy visible as part of the design process.\nthe paper suggests that viewing the expanding landscapes of postindustrial sites through the lens of entropy offers a productive framework for design and that the indeterminacies of entropic processes are analogous to productive indeterminacies

difficulties individuals face in the marketplace.\nthe impact of this work is considerable yet further research is needed to understand the contradictions and contingencies of consumer vulnerability, particularly with regard to the social consequences of consumption.\na less ambitious but nevertheless important aim is to provide consumers with 'a voice.' this is a highly significant aspect of the study of vulnerability within marketing, a discipline which has historically had a managerial focus.\nincreasingly consumer research emphasises how consumption relates to the rest of human existence, creating legitimacy for macro and non-managerial marketing topics.\na key objective of the series is to raise the profile of research with vulnerable populations of consumers within the marketing discipline by showcasing national and international research excellence.\nthe originality of this series lies in the international and interdisciplinary nature of the sessions and in its focus on the role of marketing and marketers in both enhancing and ameliorating consumer vulnerability.\nfurther, as the language and practices of business infiltrate the public sector and social service provision it would seem timely to highlight the contribution marketing and consumer researchers can make to the study of consumer vulnerability."}, "nqvkLXUBkbdzQ49TKqz9": {"short_query": "divesting identities
