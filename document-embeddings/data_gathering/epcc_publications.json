        "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a naturally occurring global phenomena that have the potential to impact fisheries, leisure and ecosystems, as well as posing a significant hazard to animal and human health. There is significant interest in the development and application of methodologies to study all aspects of the causative organisms and toxins associated with these events. This paper reports the first application of nanopore sequencing technology for the detection of eukaryotic harmful algal bloom organisms. The MinION sequencing platform from Oxford Nanopore technologies provides long read sequencing capabilities in a compact, low cost, and portable format. In this study we used the MinION to sequence long-range PCR amplicons from multiple dinoflagellate species with a focus on the genus Alexandrium. Primers applicable to a wide range of dinoflagellates were selected, meaning that although the study was primarily focused on Alexandrium the applicability to three additional genera of toxic algae, namely; Gonyaulax, Prorocentrum, and Lingulodinium was also demonstrated. The amplicon generated here spanned approximately 3 kb of the rDNA cassette, including most of the 18S, the complete ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 and regions D1 and D2 of the 28S. The inclusion of barcode genes as well as highly conserved regions resulted in identification of organisms to the species level. The analysis of reference cultures resulted in over 99% of all sequences being attributed to the correct species with an average identity above 95% from a reference list of over 200 species (see Supplementary Material 1). The use of mock community analysis within environmental samples highlighted that complex matrices did not prevent the ability to distinguish between phylogenetically similar species. Successful identification of causative organisms in environmental samples during natural toxic events further highlighted the potential of the assay. This study proves the suitability of nanopore sequencing technology for taxonomic identification of harmful algal bloom organisms and acquisition of data relevant to the World Health Organisations \"one health\" approach to marine monitoring.",

These are attractive for use as accelerators but due to limited on-chip memory and multiple levels of memory hierarchy, the way in which programmers offload kernels needs to be carefully considered. In this paper we use Python as a vehicle for exploring the semantics and abstractions of higher level programming languages to support the offloading of computational kernels to these devices. By moving to a pass by reference model, along with leveraging memory kinds, we demonstrate the ability to easily and efficiently take advantage of multiple levels in the memory hierarchy, even ones that are not directly accessible to the micro-cores. Using a machine learning benchmark, we perform experiments on both Epiphany-III and MicroBlaze based micro-cores, demonstrating the ability to compute with data sets of arbitrarily large size. To provide context of our results, we explore the performance and power efficiency of these technologies, demonstrating that whilst these two micro-core technologies are competitive within their own embedded class of hardware, there is still a way to go to reach HPC class GPUs.",

        "abstract": "The unsteady aerodynamics of floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) rotors is more complex than that of fixed\u2013bottom turbine rotors, and the uncertainty of low-fidelity aerodynamic predictions,  such as those of the blade element momentum theory (BEMT) codes,  is  higher for the former  rotors.   Navier-Stokes CFD can improve the understanding of FOWT rotor and wake aerodynamics, and help improve lower-fidelity models.  To highlight this potential, blade\u2013resolved analyses of the in-house compressible CFD COSA code and the commercial incompressible CFD code FLUENT were used to investigate the unsteady flow of the NREL 5 MW rotor subjected to prescribed harmonic pitching past the tower base.  CFD results were compared to the predictions of the FAST wind turbine code, using BEMT for rotor aerodynamics.  Improved tuning of the COSA numerical set-up enabled close matching of the FAST rotor power and loads in fixed\u2013tower mode, and high resolution of the near field wake dynamics;  similar agreement levels were obtained with the FLUENT simulations.   A novel user-defined function approach,  enforcing an additional rigid body motion of the rotor grid conformal to the tower motion, enabled the FLUENT FOWT rotor simulations of this study, and provided new general-purpose FLUENT functionalities for FOWT analyses.  All predicted periodic patterns of rotor power and thrust were found to be qualitatively similar, but the power peaks of both CFD predictions were significantly higher than those of FAST. Inspection of the CFD profiles of blade static pressure highlighted and quantified significant compressible flow effects on FOWT rotor power and loads.The blade\u2013resolved analyses of the rotor downstream flow field revealed wake features unique to pitching turbine rotors, primarily the space- and time\u2013dependence of the wake generation, highlighted by the intermittency of the tip vortex shedding.",

Asynchronous variants perform better, but an imbalance in progress can result in slower convergence or even failure to converge, as old data is used for updates. In shared memory, this can be countered using progressive load balancing (PLB). We present a distributed memory extension to PLB (DPLB) by running PLB on nodes and adding a balancing layer between nodes. We demonstrate that this method is able to mitigate system performance variation by reducing global progress imbalance 1.08x\u20134.05x and time to solution variability 1.11x\u20132.89x. In addition, the method scales without significant overhead to 100 nodes.",

The platform is Cloud-ready, and relies on the exposure of API, which are suitable for raising the abstraction level and hiding complexity. It implements the cataloguing and execution of fine-grained and Python-based dispel4py workflows as services. Reflection is achieved via a logical knowledge base, comprising multiple internal catalogues, registries and semantics, while it supports persistent and pervasive data provenance. This paper presents design and implementation aspects of the DARE platform, as well as it provides directions for future development. ",

There was no evidence of difference in any other outcome measure at 1 or 2 years. Serious adverse events, excluding mesh exposure, were similar at 1 year (standard 7/55 [13%] versus mesh inlay 5/52 [10%], risk ratio [RR] 1.05, [0.66 to 1.68]: standard 3/25 [12%] versus mesh kit 3/46 [7%], RR 0.49, [0.11 to 2.16]). Cumulative mesh exposure rates over 2 years were 7/52 (13%) in the mesh inlay arm, of whom four women required surgical revision; and 4/46 in the mesh kit arm (9%) of whom two required surgical revision.CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of a difference in terms of prolapse symptoms from the use of mesh inlays or mesh kits in women undergoing repeat prolapse surgery. Although the sample size was too small to be conclusive, the results provide a substantive contribution to future meta-analysis.",

With the growing complexity of software and computer hardware, the individuals who write research software have increasingly specialist skill sets that take time to develop and maintain.

The Research Software Engineering movement, which started in the UK and has been built up over the last few years, aims to recognise and support these individuals. We believe that an effective and sustainable model for providing Research Software Engineering capabilities is about more than just building software.

        "abstract": "Drilling boreholes for gas and oil extraction is an expensive process and profitability strongly depends on characteristics of the subsurface. As profitability is a key success factor, companies in the industry utilise well logs to explore the subsurface beforehand. These well logs contain various characteristics of the rock around the borehole, which allow petrophysicists to determine the expected amount of contained hydrocarbon. However, these logs are often incomplete and, as a consequence, the subsequent analyses cannot exploit the full potential of the well logs.In this paper we demonstrate that Machine Learning can be applied to fill in the gaps and estimate missing values. We investigate how the amount of training data influences the accuracy of prediction and how to best design regression models (Gradient Boosting and neural network) to obtain optimal results. We then explore the models' predictions both quantitatively, tracking the prediction error, and qualitatively, capturing the evolution of the measured and predicted values for a given property with depth. Combining the findings has enabled us to develop a predictive model that completes the well logs, increasing their quality and potential commercial value. ",

        "abstract": "The oil and gas industry is awash with sub-surface data, which is used to characterize the rock and fluid properties beneath the seabed. This in turn drives commercial decision making and exploration, but the industry currently relies upon highly manual workflows when processing data. A key question is whether this can be improved using machine learning to complement the activities of petrophysicists searching for hydrocarbons. In this paper we present work done using supervised machine learning with a general aim of decreasing the petrophysical interpretation time down from over 7 days to 7 minutes. We describe the use of mathematical models that have been trained using raw well log data, for completing each of the four stages of a petrophysical interpretation workflow, along with initial data cleaning. We explore how the predictions from these models compare against the interpretations of human petrophysicists, along with numerous options and techniques that were used to optimise the prediction of our models. Some popular machine learning framework are unable to take full advantage of modern HPC machines, and we explore our solutions. The result of this work is the ability, for the first time, to use machine learning for the entire petrophysical workflow.",

        "abstract": "The British Geological Survey's global geomagnetic model, Model of the Earth's Magnetic Environment (MEME), is an important tool for calculating the strength and direction of the Earth's magnetic field, which is continually in flux. Whilst the ability to collect data from ground based observation sites and satellites has grown rapidly, the memory bound nature of the original code has proved a significant limitation in modelling problem sizes required by modern science. In this paper we describe work done replacing the bespoke, sequential, eigen-solver with that of the PETSc/SLEPc package for solving the system of normal equations. Adopting PETSc/SLEPc also required fundamental changes in how we built and distributed the data structures and as such we describe an approach for building symmetric matrices that provides good load balance and avoids the need for close co-ordination between the processes or replication of work. We also study the memory bound nature of the code from an irregular memory accesses perspective and combine detailed profiling with software cache prefetching to significantly optimise this. Performance and scaling characteristics are explored on ARCHER, a Cray XC30, where we achieved a speed up for the solver of 294 times by replacing the model's bespoke approach with SLEPc.",

Reducing the cost of data movement for all computing devices is critically important, and in this paper we explore the most appropriate techniques for FPGAs. We do this by exploring the optimisations of an existing FPGA implementation of an atmospheric model's advection scheme. Taking an FPGA code that was over four times slower than running on the CPU, mainly due to data movement overhead, we describe the profiling and optimisation strategies adopted to significantly reduce the runtime and bring the performance of our FPGA kernels to a much more practical level for real-world use. The result of this work is a set of techniques, steps, and lessons learnt that we have found significantly improve the performance of FPGA based HPC codes and that others can adopt in their own codes to achieve similar improvements.",

However, the usage modes involved are rather different from how HPC has been used traditionally. As such, there are many obstacles that need to be overcome, not least the unbounded wait times in the batch system queues, to make the use of HPC in disaster response practical. In this paper, we present how the VESTEC project plans to overcome these issues and develop a working prototype of an urgent computing control system. We describe the requirements for such a system and analyse the different technologies available that can be leveraged to successfully build such a system. We finally explore the design of the VESTEC system and discuss ongoing challenges that need to be addressed to realise a production level system.",

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, the vertex-centric programming model has attracted significant attention in the world of graph processing, resulting in the emergence of a number of vertex-centric frameworks. Its simple programming interface, where computation is expressed from a vertex point of view, offers both ease of programming to the user and inherent parallelism for the underlying framework to leverage. However, vertex-centric programs represent an extreme form of irregularity, both inter and intra core. This is because they exhibit a variety of challenges from a workload that may greatly vary across supersteps, through fine-grain synchronisations, to memory accesses that are unpredictable both in terms of quantity and location. In this paper, we explore three optimisations which address these irregular challenges; a hybrid combiner carefully coupling lock-free and lock-based combinations, the partial externalisation of vertex structures to improve locality and the shift to an edge-centric representation of the workload. We also assess the suitability of more traditional optimisations such as dynamic load-balancing and software prefetching. The optimisations were integrated into the iPregel vertex-centric framework, enabling the evaluation of each optimisation in the context of graph processing across three general purpose benchmarks common in the vertex-centric community, each run on four publicly available graphs covering all orders of magnitude from a million to a billion edges. The result of this work is a set of techniques which we believe not only provide a significant performance improvement in vertex-centric graph processing, but are also applicable more generally to irregular applications.",

        "abstract": "The use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate computational kernels has the potential to be great benefit to scientific codes and the HPC community in general. With the recent developments in FPGA programming technology, the ability to port kernels is becoming far more accessible. However, to gain reasonable performance from this technology it is not enough to simple transfer a code onto the FPGA, instead the algorithm must be rethought and recast in a data-flow style to suit the target architecture. In this paper we describe the porting, via HLS, of one of the most computationally intensive kernels of the Met Office NERC Cloud model (MONC), an atmospheric model used by climate and weather researchers, onto an FPGA. We describe in detail the steps taken to adapt the algorithm to make it suitable for the architecture and the impact this has on kernel performance. Using a PCIe mounted FPGA with on-board DRAM, we consider the integration on this kernel within a larger infrastructure and explore the performance characteristics of our approach in contrast to Intel CPUs that are popular in modern HPC machines, over problem sizes involving very large grids. The result of this work is an experience report detailing the challenges faced and lessons learnt in porting this complex computational kernel to FPGAs, as well as exploring the role that FPGAs can play and their fundamental limits in accelerating traditional HPC workloads.",

In this paper we focus on the potential for HPC to be instrumental in responding to disasters such as wildfires, hurricanes, extreme flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, winter weather conditions, and accidents. Driven by the VESTEC EU funded H2020 project, our research looks to prove HPC as a tool not only capable of simulating disasters once they have happened, but also one which is able to operate in a responsive mode, supporting disaster response teams making urgent decisions in real-time. Whilst this has the potential to revolutionise disaster response, it requires the ability to drive HPC interactively, both from the user's perspective and also based upon the arrival of data. As such interactivity is a critical component in enabling HPC to be exploited in the role of supporting disaster response teams so that urgent decision makers can make the correct decision first time, every time.",

In order to compare and contrast different the micro-core architectures, a benchmark framework is required to abstract much of this complexity.The modular Eithne framework supports the comparison of a number of micro-core architectures. The framework separates the actual benchmark from the details of how this is executed on the different technologies. The framework was evaluated by running the LINPACK benchmark on the Adapteva Epiphany, PicoRV32 (RISC-V) and Orca soft-cores, NXP RV32M1, ARM Cortex-A9, and Xilinx MicroBlaze soft-core, and comparing resulting performance and power consumption.",

The recently released byte-addressable persistent non-volatile memory technology from Intel, DCPMM, promises to be an exciting opportunity to break with the status quo, with unprecedented levels of capacity at near-DRAM speeds. In this paper, we explore the potential of DCPMM in the context of high- performance scientific computing using two distinct applications in terms of outright performance, efficiency and usability for both its Memory and App Direct modes. In Memory mode, we show that it is possible to achieve equivalent performance and better efficiency for a CASTEP simulation that struggles with memory capacity limitations on conventional DRAM-only systems without needing to introduce any changes to the application. For IFS, we demonstrate that using a distributed object-store over the NVRAM devices reduces the data contention created in weather forecasting data producer-consumer workflows. In addition to presenting the impact on two applications, we also present results for achievable memory bandwidth performance using STREAM.",

However, estimating the amount of Oil In Place (OIP) relies on computing with a very significant number of geological models, which, due to the ever increasing capability to capture and refine data, is becoming infeasible. As such, data reduction techniques are required to reduce this set down to a smaller, yet still fully representative ensemble. In this paper we explore different approaches to identifying the key grouping of models, based on their most important features, and then using this information select a reduced set which we can be confident fully represent the overall model space. The result of this work is an approach which enables us to describe the entire state space using only 0.5\\% of the models, along with a series of lessons learnt. The techniques that we describe are not only applicable to oil and gas exploration, but also more generally to the HPC community as we are forced to work with reduced data-sets due to the rapid increase in data collection capability.",

An approach to the first difficulty is through the use of large-scale parallelisation, and results for a variety of physical modeling systems are presented here. Any progress with regard to the second requires, necessarily, the experience and advice of professional musicians.

Until now the FAIR principles have been mostly applied to research data. The ideas behind these principles are, however, also directly relevant to research software. Hence there is a distinct need to explore how the FAIR principles can be applied to software. In this work, we aim to summarize the current status of the debate around FAIR and software, as a basis for the development of definite community-agreed principles for FAIR research software in the future. We discuss what makes software different from data with respect to the application of the FAIR principles, present an analysis of where the existing principles can directly be applied to software, where they need to be adapted or reinterpreted, and where the definition of additional principles is required. Furthermore, we discuss desired characteristics of research software that go beyond FAIR.",

        "abstract": "As HPC systems move into the Exascale era, parallel file systems are struggling to keep up with the I/O requirements from data-intensive problems. While the inclusion of burst buffers has helped to alleviate this by improving I/O performance, it has also increased the complexity of the I/O hierarchy by adding additional storage layers each with its own semantics. This forces users to explicitly manage data movement between the different storage layers, which, coupled with the lack of interfaces to communicate data dependencies between jobs in a data-driven workflow, prevents resource schedulers from optimizing thesetransfers to benefit the cluster\u2019s overall performance. This paper proposes several extensions to job schedulers, prototyped using the Slurm scheduling system, to enable users to appropriately express the data dependencies between the different phases in their processing workflows. It also introduces a new service for asynchronous data staging called NORNS that coordinates with the job scheduler to orchestrate data transfers to achieve better resource utilization. Our evaluation shows that a workflow-aware Slurm exploits node-local storage more effectively, reducing the filesystem I/O contention and improving job running times",

        "abstract": "Composability is one of seven reasons for the long-standing and continuing success of MPI. Extending MPI by composing its operations with user-level operations provides useful integration with the progress engine and completion notification methods of MPI. However, the existing extensibility mechanism in MPI (generalized requests) is not widely utilized and has significant drawbacks.MPI can be generalized via scheduled communication primitives, for example, by utilizing implementation techniques from existing MPI-3 nonblocking collectives and from forthcoming MPI-4 persistent and partitioned APIs. Non-trivial schedules are used internally in some MPI libraries; but, they are not accessible to end-users.Message-based communication patterns can be built as libraries on top of MPI. Such libraries can have comparable implementation maturity and potentially higher performance than MPI library code, but do not require intimate knowledge of the MPI implementation. Libraries can provide performance-portable interfaces that cross MPI implementation boundaries. The ability to compose additional user-defined operations using the same progress engine benefits all kinds of general purpose HPC libraries.We propose a definition for MPI schedules: a user-level programming model suitable for creating persistent collective communication composed with new application-specific sequences of user-defined operations managed by MPI and fully integrated with MPI progress and completion notification. The API proposed offers a path to standardization for extensible communication schedules involving user-defined operations. Our approach has the potential to introduce event-driven programming into MPI (beyond the tools interface), although connecting schedules with events comprises future work.Early performance results described here are promising and indicate strong overlap potential.",

        "abstract": "The recently proposed MPI Sessions extensions to the MPI standard present a new paradigm for applications to use with MPI. MPI Sessions has the potential to address several limitations of MPI\u2019s current specification: MPI cannot be initialized within an MPI process from different application components without a priori knowledge or coordination; MPI cannot be initialized more than once; and, MPI cannot be reinitialized after MPI finalization. MPI Sessions also offers the possibility for more flexible ways for individual components of an application to express the capabilities they require from MPI at a finer granularity than is presently possible.At this time, MPI Sessions has reached sufficient maturity for implementation and evaluation, which are the focuses of this paper. This paper presents a prototype implementation of MPI Sessions, discusses certain of its performance characteristics, and describes its successful use in a large-scale production MPI application. Overall, MPI Sessions is shown to be implementable, integrable with key infrastructure, and effective, but with certain overheads involving the initialization of MPI as well as communicator construction. Small impacts on message-passing latency and throughput are noted. Open MPI was used as the implementation vehicle, but results here are also relevant to other middleware stacks.",

        "abstract": "The vertex-centric programming model, designed to improve the programmability in graph processing application writing, has attracted great attention over the years. Multiple shared memory frameworks that have implemented the vertex-centric interface all expose a common tradeoff: programmability against memory efficiency and performance.Our approach consists in preserving vertex-centric programmability, while implementing optimisations missing from Femto-Graph, developing new ones and designing these so they are transparent to a user\u2019s application code, hence not impacting programmability. We therefore implemented our own shared memory vertex-centric framework iPregel, relying on in-memory storage and synchronous execution. In this paper, we evaluate it against FemtoGraph, whose characteristics are identical, but also an asynchronous counterpart GraphChi and the vertex-subset-centric framework Ligra. Our experiments include three of the most popular vertex-centric benchmark applications over 4 real-world publicly accessible graphs, which cover all orders of magnitude between a million to a billion edges. We then measure the execution time and the peak memory usage. Finally, we evaluate the programmability of each framework by comparing it against the original Pregel, Google\u2019s closed-source implementation that started the whole area of vertex-centric programming.Experiments demonstrate that iPregel, like FemtoGraph, does not sacrifice vertex-centric programmability for additional performance and memory efficiency optimisations, which contrasts with GraphChi and Ligra. Sacrificing vertex-centric programmability allowed the latter to benefit from substantial performance and memory efficiency gains. However, experiments demonstrate that iPregel is up to 2,300 times faster than FemtoGraph, as well as generating a memory footprint up to 100 times smaller. These results greatly change the situation; Ligra and GraphChi are up to 17,000 and 700 times faster than FemtoGraph but, when comparing against iPregel, this maximum speed-up drops to 10. Furthermore, on PageRank, it is iPregel that proves to be the fastest overall. When it comes to memory efficiency, the same observation applies; Ligra and GraphChi are 100 and 50 times lighter than FemtoGraph, but iPregel nullifies these benefits: it provides the same memory efficiency as Ligra and even proves to be 3 to 6 times lighter than GraphChi on average. In other words, iPregel demonstrates that preserving vertex-centric programmability is not incompatible with a competitive performance and memory efficiency.",

In this paper, we evaluate the Arm ecosystem, both the hardware offering and the software stack that is available to users, by benchmarking a production HPC platform that uses Marvell\u2019s ThunderX2 processors. We investigate the performance of complex scientific applications across multiple nodes, and we also assess the maturity of the software stack and the ease of use from a users\u2019 perspective. This papers finds that the performance across our benchmarking applications is generally as good as, or better, than that of well-established platforms, and we can conclude from our experience that there are no major hurdles that might hinder wider adoption of this ecosystem within the HPC community.",

        "abstract": "Scientific workflows have become mainstream for conducting large-scale scientific research. As a result, many workflow applications and Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) have been developed as part of the cyberinfrastructure to allow scientists to execute their applications seamlessly on a range of distributed platforms. Although the scientific community has addressed this challenge from both theoretical and practical approaches, failure prediction, detection, and recovery still raise many research questions. In this paper, we propose an approach inspired by the control theory developed as part of autonomic computing to predict failures before they happen, and mitigated them when possible. The proposed approach is inspired on the proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative controller (PID controller) control loop mechanism, which is widely used in industrial control systems, where the controller will react to adjust its output to mitigate faults. PID controllers aim to detect the possibility of a non-steady state far enough in advance so that an action can be performed to prevent it from happening. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we tackle two common execution faults of large scale data-intensive workflows\u2014data storage overload and memory overflow. We developed a simulator, which implements and evaluates simple standalone PID-inspired controllers to autonomously manage data and memory usage of a data-intensive bioinformatics workflow that consumes/produces over 4.4 TB of data, and requires over 24 TB of memory to run all tasks concurrently. Experimental results obtained via simulation indicate that workflow executions may significantly benefit from the controller-inspired approach, in particular under online and unknown conditions. Simulation results show that nearly-optimal executions (slowdown of 1.01) can be attained when using our proposed method, and faults are detected and mitigated far in advance of their occurrence.",

        "abstract": "The oil and gas industry is awash with sub-surface data, which is used to characterize the rock and fluid properties beneath the seabed. This in turn drives commercial decision making and exploration, but the industry currently relies upon highly manual workflows when processing data. A key question is whether this can be improved using machine learning to complement the activities of petrophysicists searching for hydrocarbons. In this paper we present work done, in collaboration with Rock Solid Images (RSI), using supervised machine learning on a Cray XC30 to train models that streamline the manual data interpretation process. With a general aim of decreasing the petrophysical interpretation time down from over 7 days to 7 minutes, in this paper we describe the use of mathematical models that have been trained using raw well log data, for completing each of the four stages of a petrophysical interpretation workflow, along with initial data cleaning. We explore how the predictions from these models compare against the interpretations of human petrophysicists, along with numerous options and techniques that were used to optimise the prediction of our models. The power provided by modern supercomputers such as Cray machines is crucial here, but some popular machine learning framework are unable to take full advantage of modern HPC machines. As such we will also explore the suitability of the machine learning tools we have used, and describe steps we took to work round their limitations. The result of this work is the ability, for the first time, to use machine learning for the entire petrophysical workflow. Whilst there are numerous challenges, limitations and caveats, we demonstrate that machine learning has an important role to play in the processing of sub-surface data.",

        "abstract": "The British Geological Survey's global geomagnetic model, Model of the Earth's Magnetic Environment (MEME), is an important tool for calculating the earth's magnetic field, which is continually in flux. Whilst the ability to collect data from ground based observation sites and satellites has grown rapidly, the memory bound nature of the code has proved a significant limitation in modelling problem sizes required by modern science. In this paper we describe work done replacing the bespoke, sequential, eigen-solver with that of the SLEPc package for solving the system of normal equations. This work had a dual purpose, to break through the memory limit of the code, and thus support the modelling of much larger systems, by supporting execution on distributed machines, and to improve performance. But when adopting SLEPc it was not just the solving of the normal equations, but also fundamentally how we build and distribute the data structures. We describe an approach for building symmetric matrices in a way that provides good load balance and avoids the need for close co-ordination between the processes or replication of work. We also study the memory bound nature of the code from an irregular memory accesses perspective and combine detailed profiling with software cache prefetching to significantly optimise this. Performance and scaling characteristics are explored on ARCHER, a Cray XC30, both comparing the new model's SLEPc approach against the previous model's bespoke solver, and also considering much larger system sizes up to 100,000 model coefficients. Some of the challenges of modelling systems of this large scale are explored, and mitigations including hybrid MPI+OpenMP along with the use of iterative solvers are also considered. The result of this work is a modern MEME model that is not only capable of simulating problem sizes demanded by state of the art geomagnetism but also acts as further evidence to the utility of the SLEPc libary.",

        "abstract": "Fortran coarrays are an attractive alternative to MPI due to a familiar Fortran syntax, single sided communications and implementation in the compiler. Scaling of coarrays is compared in this work to MPI, using cellular automata (CA) 3D Ising magnetisation miniapps, built with the CASUP CA library, https://cgpack.sourceforge.io, developed by the authors. Ising energy and magnetisation were calculated with MPI_ALLREDUCE and Fortran 2018 co_sum collectives. The work was done on ARCHER (Cray XC30) up to the full machine capacity: 109,056 cores. Ping-pong latency and bandwidth results are very similar with MPI and with coarrays for message sizes from 1B to several MB. MPI halo exchange (HX) scaled better than coarray HX, which is surprising because both algorithms use pair-wise communications: MPI IRECV/ISEND/WAITALL vs Fortran sync images. Adding OpenMP to MPI or to coarrays resulted in worse L2 cache hit ratio, and lower performance in all cases, even though the NUMA effects were ruled out. This is likely because the CA algorithm is network bound at scale. This is further evidenced by the fact that very aggressive cache and inter-procedural optimisations lead to no performance gain. The sampling and tracing analysis shows good load balancing in compute in all miniapps, but imbalance in communication, indicating that the difference in performance between MPI and coarrays is likely due to parallel libraries (MPICH2 vs libpgas) and the Cray hardware specific libraries (uGNI vs DMAPP). Overall, the results look promising for coarray use beyond 100k cores. However, further coarray optimisation is needed to narrow the performance gap between coarrays and MPI.",

To that end, the group called for \u201ca paradigm shift in plant modelling, from largely isolated efforts to a connected community\u201d (Marshall-Colon et al., 2017). \u2018Wet\u2019 (experimental) research has been especially productive in plant science, since the adoption of Arabidopsis thaliana as a laboratory model species allowed the emergence of an Arabidopsis research community. Parts of this community invested in \u2018dry\u2019 (theoretical) research, under the rubric of Systems Biology. Our past research combined concepts from systems biology and crop modelling (Chew et al., 2017; Chew et al., 2014b). Here we outline the approaches that seem most relevant to connected, \u2018digital organism\u2019 initiatives. We illustrate the scale of experimental research required, by collecting the kinetic parameter values that are required for a quantitative, dynamic model of a gene regulatory network. By comparison to the SBML community, we note computational resources and community structures that will help to realise the potential for plant systems biology to connect with a broader crop science community.",

However, software itself has not traditionally received focused attention from research communities; rather, software has evolved organically and inconsistently, with its development largely as by-products of other initiatives. Moreover, challenges in scientific software are expanding due to disruptive changes in computer hardware, increasing scale and complexity of data, and demands for more complex simulations involving multiphysics, multiscale modeling and outer-loop analysis. In recent years, community members have established a range of grass-roots organizations and projects to address these growing technical and social challenges in software productivity, quality, reproducibility, and sustainability.

        "abstract": "Linking our understanding of biological processes at different scales is a major conceptual challenge in biology, which is aggravated by differences in research methods. Modelling can be a useful approach to consolidating our understanding across traditional research domains. The laboratory model species Arabidopsis thaliana is very widely used to study plant growth processes and has also been tested more recently in eco-physiology and population genetics. However, approaches from crop modelling that might link these domains are rarely applied to Arabidopsis. Here, we combine plant growth models with phenology models from eco-physiology, using the agent-based modelling language Chromar. We introduce a simpler Framework Model of vegetative growth for Arabidopsis, FM-lite. By extending this model to include inflorescence and fruit growth and seed dormancy, we present a whole-life-cycle, multi-model FM-life, which allows us to simulate at the population level in various genotype x environment scenarios. Environmental effects on plant growth distinguish between the simulated life history strategies that were compatible with previously-described Arabidopsis phenology. Our results simulate reproductive success that is founded on the broad range of physiological processes familiar from crop models and suggest an approach to simulate evolution directly in future. ",

DG formulations are often desirable due to their stability and increased accuracy, however this can come at greater computational expense due to the additional degrees of freedom in the velocity field. Additionally, data output can also be an issue, due to the increased storagerequirements. Here we present a hybrid approach, based upon the construction of an approximation of the velocity shear tensor using information from a projected Continuous Galerkin (CG) version of the discontinuous velocity field.The resulting turbulence algorithm is implemented within Fluidity, an open-source computational fluid dynamics solver. The model is then validated with a well known test case, and shown to agree favourably with published results. Comparisons are also made between the CG/DG hybrid LES with DG-only LES, which demonstrate the superior computational performance of the hybrid model.",

        "abstract": "We discuss recent progress on an essentially Lagrangian model of moist convection. In this Moist-Parcel-In-Cell (MPIC) model, parcels represent both the thermodynamic and the dynamical properties of the flow. The parcels have a finite volume and carry part of the circulation and thermodynamic attributes (liquid water potential temperature and total water content). The representation of parcel properties is fully Lagrangian, but an efficient grid-based solver calculates parcel advection velocities.The Lagrangian approach of MPIC has a number of advantages: thermodynamic properties and their corre- lations are naturally conserved, and the amount of mixing between parcels can be explicitly controlled. MPIC also lends itself well to parallelisation, because most of the communication required between processors is local, and an efficient solver is available where global communication is required.A massively parallel version of MPIC which uses the framework of the Met Office NERC Cloud (MONC) model has recently been developed. This version will make it possible to simulate realistic clouds in a fully Lagrangian framework. Here, we present the adaptations we have made to MPIC, and in particular its dynamical core, to facilitate such simulations, and discuss the steps we are taking to include microphysics. We also show scaling results of the new code for up to 50,000 compute cores.",

An SMP also helps you to understand how you can support those who wish to, or do, use your research software; how your software relates to other artefacts in your research ecosystem; and how you will ensure that your software remains available beyond the lifetime of your current project.This checklist will help you to write an SMP. It consists of sections that cover the key elements that an SMP should include.",

To take advantage of the PGAS APIs like global address space programming interface (GASPI) without a major change in the code basis, interoperability between MPI and PGAS approaches needs to be ensured. In this article, we consider an interoperable GASPI/MPI implementation for the communication/performance crucial parts of the Ludwig and iPIC3D applications. To address the discovered performance limitations, we develop a novel strategy for significantly improved performance and interoperability between both APIs by leveraging GASPI shared windows and shared notifications. First results with a corresponding implementation in the MiniGhost proxy application and the Allreduce collective operation demonstrate the viability of this approach.",

        "abstract": "A 3D multi-scale cellular automata finite element (CAFE) framework for modelling fracture in heterogeneous materials is described. The framework is implemented in a hybrid MPI/Fortran coarray code for efficient parallel execution on HPC platforms. Two open source BSD licensed libraries developed by the authors in modern Fortran were used: CGPACK, implementing cellular automata (CA) using Fortran coarrays, and ParaFEM, implementing finite elements (FE) using MPI. The framework implements a two-way concurrent hierarchical information exchange between the structural level (FE) and the microstructure (CA). MPI to coarrays interface and data structures are described. The CAFE framework is used to predict transgranular cleavage propagation in a polycrystalline iron round bar under tension. Novel results enabled by this CAFE framework include simulation of progressive cleavage propagation through individual grains and across grain boundaries, and emergence of a macro-crack from merging of cracks on preferentially oriented cleavage planes in individual crystals. Nearly ideal strong scaling up to at least tens of thousands of cores was demonstrated by CGPACK and by ParaFEM in isolation in prior work on Cray XE6. Cray XC30 and XC40 platforms and CrayPAT profiling were used in this work. Initially the strong scaling limit of hybrid CGPACK/ParaFEM CAFE model was 2000 cores. After replacing all-to-all communication patterns with the nearest neighbour algorithms the strong scaling limit on Cray XC30 was increased to 7000 cores. TAU profiling on non-Cray systems identified deficiencies in Intel Fortran 16 optimisation of remote coarray operations. Finally, coarray synchronisation challenges and opportunities for thread parallelisation in CA are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Open-source matters, not just to the current cohort of HPC users but also to potential new HPC communities, such as machine learning, themselves often rooted in open-source. Many of these potential new workloads are, by their very nature, far more asynchronous and unpredictable than traditional HPC codes and open-source solutions must be found to enable new communities of developers to easily take advantage of large scale parallel machines. Task-based models have the potential to help here, but many of these either entirely abstract the user from the distributed nature of their code, placing emphasis on the runtime to make important decisions concerning scheduling and locality, or require the programmer to explicitly combine their task based code with a distributed memory technology such as MPI, which adds considerable complexity. In this paper we describe a new approach where the programmer still splits their code up into distinct tasks, but is explicitly aware of the distributed nature of the machine and drives interactions between tasks via events. This provides the best of both worlds; the programmer is able to direct important aspects of parallelism whilst still being abstracted from the low level mechanism of how this parallelism is achieved. We demonstrate our approach via two use-cases, the Graph500 BFS benchmark and in-situ data analytics of MONC, an atmospheric model. For both applications we demonstrate considerably improved performance at large core counts and the result of this work is an approach and open-source library which is readily applicable to a wide range of codes.",

We describe the architecture and functionality of the library and the C and For- tran APIs which can be used to interface additional MD codes to MIST. We show, for a range of test systems, that MIST introduces negligible overheads for serial, shared-memory parallel, and GPU-accelerated cases, except for Amber where the native integrators run directly on the GPU itself.

        "abstract": "Remote Memory Access (RMA), also known as single\u2010sided communications, provides a way for reading and writing directly into the memory of other processes without having to issue explicit message passing style communication calls. Previous studies have concluded that MPI RMA can provide increased communication performance over traditional MPI Point to Point (P2P), but these are based on synthetic benchmarks rather than real\u2010world codes. In this work, we replace the existing non\u2010blocking P2P communication calls in the Met Office NERC Cloud model, a mature code for modeling the atmosphere, with MPI RMA. We describe our approach in detail and discuss the options taken for correctness and performance. Experiments are performed on ARCHER, a Cray XC30, and Cirrus, an SGI ICE machine. We demonstrate on ARCHER that, by using RMA, we can obtain between a 5% and 10% reduction in communication time at each timestep on up to 32768 cores, which over the entirety of a run (with many timesteps) results in a significant improvement in performance compared to P2P on the Cray. However, RMA is not a silver bullet, and there are challenges when integrating RMA calls into existing codes: important optimizations are necessary to achieve good performance and library support is not universally mature, as is the case on Cirrus. In this paper, we discuss, in the context of a real\u2010world code, the lessons learned converting P2P to RMA, explore performance and scaling challenges, and contrast alternative RMA synchronization approaches in detail.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose an API to pause and resume task execution depending on external events. We leverage this generic API to improve the interoperability between MPI synchronous communication primitives and tasks. When an MPI operation blocks, the task running is paused so that the runtime system can schedule a new task on the core that became idle. Once the MPI operation is completed, the paused task is put again on the runtime system's ready queue. We expose our proposal through a new MPI threading level which we implement through two approaches.The first approach is an MPI wrapper library that works with any MPI implementation by intercepting MPI synchronous calls, implementing them on top of their asynchronous counterparts. In this case, the task-based runtime system is also extended to periodically check for pending MPI operations and resume the corresponding tasks once MPI operations complete. The second approach consists in directly modifying the MPICH runtime system, a well-known implementation of MPI, to directly call the pause/resume API when a synchronous MPI operation blocks and completes, respectively.Our experiments reveal that this proposal not only simplifies the development of hybrid MPI+OpenMP applications that naturally overlap computation and communication phases; it also improves application performance and scalability by removing artificial dependencies across communication tasks.",

        "abstract": "Research software is an integral part of the modern research ecosystem. Taken together, research software, alongside data, facilities, equipment and an overarching research question can be viewed as a research activity or experiment, worthy to be published. Conversely, a publication can be considered as a narrative that describes how the research objects are used together to reply to the research question.Depositing research software into a digital repository can offer significant benefits. By depositing not just papers, but software, and data sets, as well, researchers can store a more complete record of this ecosystem for future use to both the researchers who undertook the research and also the wider research community. Making research software available allows other researchers to inspect, replicate, reproduce and reuse the research, as manifested in the software, in the short term and to inspect, for the historical record, in the long term. It allows research software to remain available beyond the lifetime of any current project, or a researcher's current employment at a specific institution. Digital repositories can also provide unique persistent digital identifiers for software which can be cited and help researchers to get attribution and credit for their research software when it is used by others.The Software Sustainability Institute, funded by Jisc have developed a set of complementary guides covering the main aspects of depositing software into digital repositories. These guides are intended for researchers, principal investigators and research leaders and research data and digital repository managers. This document provides an overview of the content covered by the guides.",

The resulting morphology is primarily controlled by an inverse capillary number, $\\chi$, setting the balance between interfacial and elastic forces. When $\\chi$ and the concentration of the isotropic component are both low, the blue phase disclination lattice templates a cubic array of fluid cylinders. For larger $\\chi$, the isotropic phase arranges primarily into liquid emulsion droplets which coarsen very slowly, rewiring the blue phase disclination lines into an amorphous elastic network. Our blue phase/simple fluid composites can be externally manipulated: an electric field can trigger a morphological transition between cubic fluid cylinder phases with different topologies. ",

A group working as part of the FORCE11 community developed a set of principles for software citation that fit software into the journal citation system, allow software to be published and then cited, and there are now over 50,000 DOIs that have been issued for software. However, some challenges remain, including: promoting the idea of software citation to developers and users; collaborating with publishers to ensure that systems collect and retain required metadata; ensuring that the rest of the scholarly infrastructure, particularly indexing sites, include software; working with communities so that software efforts \u201ccount\u201d; and understanding how best to cite software that has not been published.",

In flipped classes students encounter the content through pre-class resources, freeing up class time for more active engagement with the material. This results in increased opportunities for teacher-student interactions which may be beneficial for learning. Our aim here is to explore the nature and purposes of these dialogues. Two case studies from introductory physics classes at the University of Edinburgh are analysed through a sociocultural perspective. Three main purposes of dialogues are observed: (1) Involving students in sense-making, (2) Guided expert modelling and (3) Wonderment questions. We found that the dialogues predominantly use a triadic Initiation, Response, Feedback (IRF) format and are authoritative in nature, but work together to create an interactive learning environment that can be described as \u2018ideologically dialogic\u2019",

The laboratory model species Arabidopsis thaliana is very widely used to study plant growth processes and has also been tested more recently in eco-physiology and population genetics. However, approaches from crop modelling that might link these domains are rarely applied to Arabidopsis. Here, we combine plant growth models with phenology models from eco-physiology, using the agent-based modelling language Chromar. We introduce a simpler Framework Model of vegetative growth for Arabidopsis, FM-lite. By extending this model to include inflorescence and fruit growth and seed dormancy, we present a whole-life-cycle, multi-model FM-life, which allows us to simulate at the population level in various genotype x environment scenarios. Environmental effects on plant growth distinguish between the simulated life history strategies that were compatible with previously-described Arabidopsis phenology. Our results simulate reproductive success that is founded on the broad range of physiological processes familiar from crop models and suggest an approach to simulate evolution directly in future.",

        "abstract": "In task based models, by rethinking parallelism in the paradigm of tasks one reduces synchronisation and decouples the management of parallelism from computation. However existing models typically rely on shared memory, where the programmer expresses input and output dependencies of tasks based upon variables. To then execute these over large scale distributed memory machines requires complex support in the runtime system which the programmer has no control over. We propose an alternative approach where the programmer still works with the concept of tasks but is explicitly aware of the distributed nature of their code and drives interactions through events. Tasks are scheduled and depend upon a number of events arriving, which may originate from tasks running remotely or locally, before they can execute. Events are explicitly \u201cfired\u201d to a target by the programmer with an associated identifier, which is used to match up dependencies, and optionally contain data which tasks can process. This enables the programmer to write large-scale task based codes, still abstracted from the mechanism of parallelism but with a general understanding of how their system is interacting which is useful for optimisation such as locality. Furthermore, as the entire state of the code can be expressed as outstanding events and scheduled tasks, this enables ACID compliance which provides resilience. Our approach works especially well for parallel codes that contain irregular communication patterns, such as in-situ data analytics, and can be applied incrementally to existing MPI based codes to break apart the bulk synchronous nature of the communications.",

        "abstract": "Remote Memory Access (RMA), also known as single sided communications, provides a way for reading and writing directly into the memory of other processes without having to issue explicit message passing style communication calls. Previous studies have concluded that MPI RMA can provide increased communication performance over traditional MPI Point to Point (P2P) but these are based on synthetic benchmarks rather than real world codes. In this work, we replace the existing non-blocking P2P communication calls in the Met Office NERC Cloud model, a mature code for modelling the atmosphere, with MPI RMA. We describe our approach in detail and discuss the options taken for correctness and performance. Experiments are performed on ARCHER, a Cray XC30 and Cirrus, an SGI ICE machine. We demonstrate on ARCHER that by using RMA we can obtain between a 10-20\\% reduction in communication time at each timestep on up to 32768 cores, which over the entirety of a run (with many timesteps) results in a significant improvement in performance compared to P2P on the Cray. However, RMA is not a silver bullet and there are challenges when integrating RMA calls into existing codes: important optimisations are necessary to achieve good performance and library support is not universally mature, as is the case on Cirrus. In this paper we discuss, in the context of a real world code, the lessons learned converting P2P to RMA, explore performance and scaling challenges, and contrast alternative RMA synchronisation approaches in detail.",

        "abstract": "Macro-modeling of cerebral blood flow can help determine the impact of thermal intervention during instances of head trauma to mitigate tissue damage. This work presents a bioheat model using a 3D fluid-porous domain coupled with intersecting 1D arterial and venous vessel trees. This combined vascular porous (VaPor) model resolves both cerebral blood flow and energy equations, including heat generated by metabolism, using vasculature extracted from MRI data and is extended using a tree generation algorithm. Counter-current flows are expected to increase thermal transfer within the brain and are enforced using either the vascular structure or flow reversal, represented by a flow reversal constant, C R . These methods exhibit larger average brain cooling (from 0.56\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u2009<0.01\u2009\u00b0C to 0.58\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u2009<0.01\u2009\u00b0C) compared with previous models (0.39\u2009\u00b0C) when scalp temperature is reduced. An greater reduction in core brain temperature is observed (from 0.29\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u2009<0.01\u2009\u00b0C to 0.45\u2009\u00b0C\u2009\u00b1\u2009<0.01\u2009\u00b0C) compared to previous models (0.11\u2009\u00b0C) due to the inclusion of counter-current cooling effects. The VaPor model also predicts that a hypothermic average temperature (<36\u2009\u00b0C) can be reached in core regions of neonatal models using scalp cooling alone.",

The tool enables, to our knowledge for the first time, a network-level analysis of polarity and flow for individual endothelial cells. To date, PolNet has proven invaluable for the study of endothelial cell polarization and migration during vascular patterning, as demonstrated by two recent publications.

In this paper, we discuss general SCM characteristics, including the different hardware configurations and data access mechanisms SCM is likely to provide. We outline the performance challenges I/O requirements place on traditional scientific workflows and present how data access through SCM can have a beneficial impact on the performance of such workflows, in particular those with large scale data dependencies. We describe the system software components that are required to enabled workflow and data aware resource allocation scheduling in order to optimise both system throughput and time to solution for individual applications; these include a data scheduler and data movers. We also present an illustration of the performance improvement potential of the technology, based on initial workflow performance benchmarks with I/O dependencies.",

Both features are paramount for using COSA efficiently for large-scale production simulations using tens of thousands of computational cores.

        "abstract": "Genetic variants underlying complex traits, including disease susceptibility, are enriched within the transcriptional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers. There is emerging evidence that regulatory elements associated with particular traits or diseases share similar patterns of transcriptional activity. Accordingly, shared transcriptional activity (coexpression) may help prioritise loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify underlying biological processes. Using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter- and enhancer-derived RNAs across 1824 human samples, we have analysed coexpression of RNAs originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel quantitative method (network density analysis; NDA). For most traits studied, phenotype-associated variants in regulatory regions were linked to tightly-coexpressed networks that are likely to share important functional characteristics. Coexpression provides a new signal, independent of phenotype association, to enable fine mapping of causative variants. The NDA coexpression approach identifies new genetic variants associated with specific traits, including an association between the regulation of the OCT1 cation transporter and genetic variants underlying circulating cholesterol levels. NDA strongly implicates particular cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis. For example, distinct groupings of disease-associated regulatory regions implicate two distinct biological processes in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis; a further two separate processes are implicated in Crohn's disease. Thus, our functional analysis of genetic predisposition to disease defines new distinct disease endotypes. We predict that patients with a preponderance of susceptibility variants in each group are likely to respond differently to pharmacological therapy. Together, these findings enable a deeper biological understanding of the causal basis of complex traits.",

        "abstract": "Obtaining real-time information about a geohazard event as it unfolds, such as a flood or earthquake, used to be largely limited to the professional media. Nowadays, obtaining news stories from social media (eg Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr etc.), directly as they unfold, is becoming the 'norm'for many in society. The Haitian Earthquake in January 2010 and the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011, provided some of the first natural hazard examples, to really demonstrate the power of social media over traditional news sources for obtaining, live information from which people and authorities could gain situational awareness.",

        "abstract": "MONC is a highly scalable modelling tool for the investigation of atmospheric flows, turbulence, and cloud microphysics. Typical simulations produce very large amounts of raw data, which must then be analysed for scientific investigation. For performance and scalability reasons, this analysis and subsequent writing to disk should be performed in situ on the data as it is generated; however, one does not wish to pause the computation whilst analysis is carried out. In this paper, we present the analytics approach of MONC, where cores of a node are shared between computation and data analytics. By asynchronously sending their data to an analytics core, the computational cores can run continuously without having to pause for data writing or analysis. We describe our IO server framework and analytics workflow, which is highly asynchronous, along with solutions to challenges that this approach raises and the performance implications of some common configuration choices. The result of this work is a highly scalable analytics approach, and we illustrate on up to 32 768 computational cores of a Cray XC30 that there is minimal performance impact on the runtime when enabling data analytics in MONC and also investigate the performance and suitability of our approach on the KNL.",

        "abstract": "The unsteady aerodynamics of floating offshore wind turbine rotors is more complex than that of fixed-bottom turbine rotors, due to additional rigid-body motion components enabled by the lack of rigid foundations; it is still unclear if low-fidelity aerodynamic models, such as the blade element momentum theory, provide sufficiently reliable input for floating turbine design requiring load data for a wide range of operating conditions. High-fidelity Navies-Stokes CFD has the potential to improve the understanding of FOWT rotor aerodynamics, and support the improvement of lower-fidelity aerodynamic analysis models. To accomplish these aims, this study uses an in-house compressible Navier-Stokes code and the NREL FAST engineering code to analyze the unsteady flow regime of the NREL 5 MW rotor pitching with amplitude of 4o and frequency of 0.2 Hz, and compares all results to those obtained with a commercial incompressible code and FAST in a previous independent study. The level of agreement of CFD and engineering analyses in each of these two studies is found to be quantitatively similar, but the peak rotor power of the compressible flow analysis is about 20 % higher than that of the incompressible analysis. This is possibly due to compressibility effects, as the instantaneous local Mach number is found to be higher than 0.4. Validation of the compressible flow analysis set-up, using an absolute frame formulation and low-speed preconditioning, is based on the analysis of the steady and yawed flow past the NREL Phase VI rotor.",

These can be used as a co-processor or standalone but due to limited on-chip memory and esoteric nature of the hardware, writing efficient parallel codes for them is challenging. We previously developed ePython, a low memory (24Kb) implementation of Python supporting the rapid development of parallel Python codes and education for these architectures. In this poster we present our work on an offload abstraction to support the use of micro-cores as an accelerator. Programmers decorate specific functions in their Python code, running under any Python interpreter on the host, with our underlying technology then responsible for the low-level data movement, scheduling and execution of kernels on the micro-cores. Aimed at education and fast prototyping, a machine learning code for detecting lung cancer, where computational kernels are offloaded to micro-cores, is used to illustrate the approach.",

We review a number of the most popular simulation methods that have emerged, such as Langevin dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, multi-particle collision dynamics, sometimes also referred to as stochastic rotation dynamics, and the lattice-Boltzmann method. We conclude this review with a short glance at current compute architectures for high-performance computing and community codes for soft matter simulation.",

Through computer simulations, we measure the apparent viscosity as a function of droplet concentration and pressure gradient, and provide evidence of a discontinuous shear thinning behavior, which occurs at a concentration-dependent value of the forcing. We further show that this response is associated with a nonequilibrium transition between a \"hard\" (or less deformable) phase, which is nearly jammed and flows very slowly, and a \"soft\" (or more deformable) phase, which flows much more easily. The soft phase is characterized by flow-induced time dependent shape deformations and internal currents, which are virtually absent in the hard phase. Close to the transition, we find sustained oscillations in both the droplet and fluid velocities. Polydisperse systems show similar phenomenology but with a smoother transition, and less regular oscillations.",

Using asynchronous or semi-synchronous algorithms can help overcome this issue, but at the cost of reduced stability or convergence rate. In this paper we propose progressive load balancing to manage progress imbalance in asynchronous algorithms dynamically. In our technique the balancing is done over time, not instantaneously.Using Jacobi iterations as a test case, we show that, with CPU performance variability present, this approach leads to higher iteration rate and lower progress imbalance between parts of the solution space. We also show that under these conditions the balanced asynchronous method outperforms synchronous, semi-synchronous and totally asynchronous implementations in terms of time to solution.",

        "abstract": "On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The\u00a0Fermi\u00a0Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of\u00a0\u00a0with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2\u00a0at a luminosity distance of\u00a0\u00a0Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26\u00a0. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at\u00a0) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ~10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC 4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of\u00a0r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.",

        "abstract": "CFD is a ubiquitous technique central to much of computational simulation such as that required by aircraft design. Solving of the Poisson equation occurs frequently in CFD and there are a number of possible approaches one may leverage. The dynamical core of the MONC atmospheric model is one example of CFD which requires the solving of the Poisson equation to determine pressure terms. Traditionally this aspect of the model has been very time consuming and-so it is important to consider how we might reduce the runtime cost.In this paper we survey the different approaches implemented in MONC to perform the pressure solve. Designed to take advantage of large scale, modern, HPC machines, we are concerned with the computation and communication behaviour of the available techniques and in this text we focus on direct FFT and indirect iterative methods. In addition to describing the implementation of these techniques we illustrate on up to 32768 processor cores of a Cray XC30 both the performance and scalability of our approaches. Raw runtime is not the only measure so we also make some comments around the stability and accuracy of solution. The result of this work are a number of techniques, optimised for large scale HPC systems, and an understanding of which is most appropriate in different situations.",

        "abstract": "Whilst there have been great advances in HPC hardware and software in recent years, the languages and models that we use to program these machines have remained much more static. This is not from a lack of effort, but instead by virtue of the fact that the foundation that many programming languages are built on is not sufficient for the level of expressivity required for parallel work. The result is an implicit trade-off between programmability and performance which is made worse due to the fact that, whilst many scientific users are experts within their own fields, they are not HPC experts.Type oriented programming looks to address this by encoding the complexity of a language via the type system. Most of the language functionality is contained within a loosely coupled type library that can be flexibly used to control many aspects such as parallelism. Due to the high level nature of this approach there is much information available during compilation which can be used for optimisation and, in the absence of type information, the compiler can apply sensible default options thus supporting both the expert programmer and novice alike.We demonstrate that, at no performance or scalability penalty when running on up to 8196 cores of a Cray XE6 system, codes written in this type oriented manner provide improved programmability. The programmer is able to write simple, implicit parallel, HPC code at a high level and then explicitly tune by adding additional type information if required.",

Such data is of quantifiable operational value to corporate data owners, however, unlocking its strategic value through inductive \u2018Big Data\u2019 analysis invites a company to give access to that data before the bounds on data value can be fully assessed. This requires high degrees of trust. In this paper we report results from a decade of infrastructure and trust building that has allowed exploration of technology diffusion in China, the world\u2019s largest market for digital technologies. We innovate by including in our sample both early adoption and early rejection of a new technology to enable characterization of the first stage of the diffusion process: \u2018Experiri\u2019 \u2013 to try out. We explore this by examining consumer channel choice over a period of two years for over 1 million individual consumers and over 1000 products. Using a highly scalable data-mining tool we demonstrate that propensity to experiment with new channels is predictable and has a dependency on the demographics of the consumer. This offers the possibility of better management of new technology introduction and market development.",

By combining simulations with analytic calculations, we show that the hydrodynamic coupling between the squirmer flow field and liquid crystalline director can lead to reorientation of the swimmers. The preferred orientation depends on the exact details of the squirmer flow field. In a steady state, pushers are shown to swim parallel with the nematic director while pullers swim perpendicular to the nematic director. This behavior arises solely from hydrodynamic coupling between the squirmer flow field and anisotropic viscosities of the host fluid. Our results suggest that an anisotropic swimming medium can be used to characterize and guide spherical microswimmers in the bulk.",

        "abstract": "Carbon markets are key components in the climate change mitigation response, enabling a price to be placed on carbon emissions. Connecting these markets has the potential to allow a more integrated, efficient, and globally consistent price on carbon which will promote greater confidence in the market, investment and, ultimately, help foster new technology development through climate finance.The challenge to connecting carbon markets is that each individual carbon market has its own legal and regulatory framework and its own rules for assigning and accounting for the carbon units traded. This presents significant legal and political hurdles that rule out a single, global, carbon market being established. An alternative, \u2018bottom-up\u2019 solution, to enable carbon trading between a range of markets without forcing legal and regulatory homogeneous standardisation and conformity on those markets, would be a more practical way to connect them.One candidate technology to facilitate such connection, is the \u2018Distributed Ledger\u2019 (DL), which provides the combination of a distributed database with public/private key encryption and a decentralised infrastructure. This potentially allows for innovative solutions to data sharing, or transaction management application areas, making it a good first-order match to the emerging requirements for an interoperable carbon market infrastructure.To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, a solution needs to be found that facilitates a global-scale distributed infrastructure, which allows a diverse set of markets and participants to utilise and exploit it. The established literature on innovation and technology diffusion gives guidance on this issue, but no ability to predict success.The purpose of this White Paper, therefore, is to outline the most important questions identified in relation to the connecting of carbon markets through the application of DL technologies, and outline the authors\u2019 current thoughts on those questions.",

        "abstract": "The transition to the Exascale predicts the appearance of more complex architectures. Such systems may have a huge number of multi-core nodes, deep memory hierarchies and complex interconnect topologies. Efficiently programming them requires new adequate programming models and currently, the task-based models are perceived as a very promising candidate to start with; they abstract the notion of parallelism from the application developer and offer better perspectives for efficiently exploiting heterogeneous architectures. One of the tasks defined in the INTERTWinE project funded by the European Commission is the definition of a common, generic API for a directory/cache service for task-based runtime systems (like OmpSs, StarPU, etc.). The main purpose of the directory/cache is to provide a set of services that allow task-based runtime systems to efficiently run distributed applications, while being able to consistently manage data stored in distributed memory or in local caches. The directory/cache API allows the task-based runtimes to be completely independent from the physical representation of data and from the type of storage used, facilitating the access through the same interface to an extendable list of memory segment implementations (GASPI, MPI, etc). Moreover, applications may also use the directory/cache API directly. In this poster we try to highlight some of the relevant aspects related to the resulted directory/cache API and the architectural concept.",

        "abstract": "It is widely accepted that for codes to take advantage of exa-scale systems, programmers will need to work at different level of parallelism. Inevitably this will involve combining different programming technologies in a code and these interoperating together. An example of this is task based models, which work well in shared memory, but to scale these out to distributed memory machines requires the combination of other technologies such as MPI. We have developed a directory/cache which can be integrated with higher level programming language runtimes and enables transparent (to the end user) interoperability between shared memory and distributed memory technologies such as task based models and MPI. \n\nThe directory/cache presents a single, unified global view of memory to users, abstracting them from the underlying complexity of how memory is physically distributed across nodes and issues such as the uneven decomposition of data. Internally MPI RMA is used as the underlying transport layer, the ubiquity and predictable performance of MPI RMA meant that this was a natural choice. We illustrate how this RMA transport layer has been implemented and several recent features from MPI version 3 standard that we rely upon to support transparent data movement. Abstraction can come at a cost to performance, to understand this a benchmark (block Cholesky matrix factorisation) has been developed and we present performance & scaling results in comparison to direct passive and active target synchronisation MPI RMA implementations. This benchmark is also used to briefly illustrate how the directory/cache might be used in code.",

BeatBox is a free software written in C language to be run on a Unix-based platform. It provides the whole spectrum of multi scale tissue modelling from 0-dimensional individual cell simulation, 1-dimensional fibre, 2-dimensional sheet and 3-dimensional slab of tissue, up to anatomically realistic whole heart simulations, with run time measurements including cardiac re-entry tip/filament tracing, ECG, local/global samples of any variables, etc. BeatBox solvers, cell, and tissue/anatomy models repositories are extended via robust and flexible interfaces, thus providing an open framework for new developments in the field.

Typical simulations produce very large amounts of raw data, which must then be analysed for scientific investigation. For performance and scalability reasons, this analysis and subsequent writing to disk should be performed in situ on the data as it is generated; however, one does not wish to pause the computation whilst analysis is carried out. In this paper, we present the analytics approach of MONC, where cores of a node are shared between computation and data analytics. By asynchronously sending their data to an analytics core, the computational cores can run continuously without having to pause for data writing or analysis. We describe our IO server framework and analytics workflow, which is highly asynchronous, along with solutions to challenges that this approach raises and the performance implications of some common configuration choices. The result of this work is a highly scalable analytics approach, and we illustrate on up to 32 768 computational cores of a Cray XC30 that there is minimal performance impact on the runtime when enabling data analytics in MONC and also investigate the performance and suitability of our approach on the KNL.",

        "abstract": "CASIM is a microphysics scheme which calculates the interaction between moisture droplets in the atmosphere and forms a critical part of weather and climate modelling codes. However the calculations involved are computationally intensive and so investigating whether CASIM can take advantage of novel hardware architectures and the likely increase in performance this might afford makes sense. In this paper we  present work done in porting CASIM to GPUs via the directive driven OpenACC and also modifying CASIM to take advantage of the Knights Landing (KNL) processor using OpenMP. Due to the design, models extracting out specific computational kernels for offload to the GPU proved suboptimal and instead the entire scheme was ported over to the GPU. We consider the suitability and maturity of OpenACC for this approach as well as important optimisations that were identified. Enabling CASIM to take advantage of the KNL was significantly easier, but still required careful experimentation to understand the best design and configuration. The performance of both versions of CASIM, in comparison to the latest generation of CPUs is discussed, before identifying lessons learnt about the suitability of CASIM and other similar models for these architectures. The result of this work are versions of CASIM which show promising performance benefits when utilising both GPUs and KNLs and enable the communities to take advantage of these technologies, in addition to general techniques that can be applied to other similar weather and climate models.

        "abstract": "Automation of the execution of computational tasks is at the heart of improving scientific productivity. Over the last years, scientific workflows have been established as an important abstraction that captures data processing and computation of large and complex scientific applications. By allowing scientists to model and express entire data processing steps and their dependencies, workflow management systems relieve scientists from the details of an application and manage its execution on a computational infrastructure. As the resource requirements of today\u2019s computational and data science applications that process vast amounts of data keep increasing, there is a compelling case for a new generation of advances in high-performance computing, commonly termed as extreme-scale computing, which will bring forth multiple challenges for the design of workflow applications and management systems. This paper presents a novel characterization of workflow management systems using features commonly associated with extreme-scale computing applications. We classify 15 popular workflow management systems in terms of workflow execution models, heterogeneous computing environments, and data access methods. The paper also surveys workflow applications and identifies gaps for future research on the road to extreme-scale workflows and management systems.",

The highly optimized sparse linear algebra library DBCSR (Distributed Block Compressed Sparse Row) has been specifically designed to efficiently perform such sparse matrix-matrix multiplications. This library is the basic building block for linear scaling electronic structure theory and low scaling correlated methods in CP2K. It is parallelized using MPI and OpenMP, and can exploit GPU accelerators by means of CUDA. We describe a performance comparison of DBCSR on systems with Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing (KNL) processors, with respect to systems with Intel Xeon CPUs (including systems with GPUs).We find that the DBCSR on Cray XC40 KNL-based systems is 11%-14% slower than on a hybrid Cray XC50 with Nvidia P100 cards, at the same number of nodes. When compared to a Cray XC40 system equipped with dual-socket Intel Xeon CPUs, the KNL is up to 24% faster.Note: A full version of the article is available as a pre-print at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03604.pdf",

Morphological classification performed on spatially-resolved stellar\nmass maps indicates a mixture of disk and morphologically disturbed\nsystems; half of the sample harbor X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN),\nthereby representing a diversity of $z \\sim 2$ SFGs undergoing vigorous\nmass assembly. We find that their intense star formation most frequently\noccurs at the location of stellar-mass concentration and extends over an\narea comparable to their stellar-mass distribution, with a median\ndiameter of $4.2 \\pm 1.8$ kpc. This provides direct evidence for\ngalaxy-wide star formation in distant, blank-field-selected\nmain-sequence SFGs. The typical galactic-average SFR surface density is\n2.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$, sufficiently high to drive outflows.\nIn X-ray-selected AGN where radio emission is enhanced over the level\nassociated with star formation, the radio excess pinpoints the AGN,\nwhich are found to be co-spatial with star formation. The median\nextinction-independent size of main-sequence SFGs is two times larger\nthan those of bright submillimeter galaxies whose SFRs are $3-8$ times\nlarger, providing a constraint on the characteristic SFR ($\\sim300$\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) above which a significant population of more\ncompact star-forming galaxies appears to emerge.",

Their appeal to users increased substantially when they were standardised in 2010. In this work we show that coarrays offer simple and intuitive data structures for 3D cellular automata (CA) modelling of material microstructures. We show how coarrays can be used together with an MPI finite element (FE) library to create a two-way concurrent hierarchical and scalable multi-scale CAFE deformation and fracture framework. Design of a coarray cellular automata microstructure evolution library CGPACK is described. A highly portable MPI FE library ParaFEM was used in this work. We show that independently CGPACK and ParaFEM programs can scale up well into tens of thousands of cores. Strong scaling of a hybrid ParaFEM/CGPACK MPI/coarray multi-scale framework was measured on an important solid mechanics practical example of a fracture of a steel round bar under tension. That program did not scale beyond 7 thousand cores. Excessive synchronisation might be one contributing factor to relatively poor scaling. Therefore we conclude with a comparative analysis of synchronisation requirements in MPI and coarray programs. Specific challenges of synchronising a coarray library are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The Epiphany is a many-core, low power, low on-chip memory architecture and one can very cheaply gain access to a number of parallel cores which is beneficial for HPC education and prototyping. The very low power nature of these architectures also means that there is potential for their use in future HPC machines, however there is a high barrier to entry in programming them due to the associated complexities and immaturity of supporting tools. In this paper we present our work on ePython, a subset of Python for the Epiphany and similar many-core co-processors. Due to the limited on-chip memory per core we have developed a new Python interpreter and this, combined with additional support for parallelism, has meant that novices can take advantage of Python to very quickly write parallel codes on the Epiphany and explore concepts of HPC using a smaller scale parallel machine. The high level nature of Python opens up new possibilities on the Epiphany, we examine a computationally intensive Gauss-Seidel code from the programmability and performance perspective, discuss running Python hybrid on both the host CPU and Epiphany, and interoperability between a full Python interpreter on the CPU and ePython on the Epiphany. The result of this work is support for developing Python on the Epiphany, which can be applied to other similar architectures, that the community have already started to adopt and use to explore concepts of parallelism and HPC.",

        "abstract": "In computing science, much attention has been paid to generic methods for sharing data in secure infrastructures. These sorts of methods and  infrastructures are, of course, necessary for sharing healthcare data. We are, however, a long way away from being able to realise the potential of medical and healthcare data to support the sorts of extensive, data-intensive experiments being demanded by precision and stratified medicine. A key architectural problem remaining to be solved is how to maintain control of patient data within the governance of local data jurisdictions while also allowing these jurisdictions to engage with experiment designs that (because of the need to scale to large population sizes) may require analyses across several jurisdictions. This paper provides a snapshot of architectural work underway to provide a clear, effective structure of data safe havens within jurisdictions. It then describes how formally specified experiment designs can be used single jurisdiction could tackle alone. Our current work relates to two jurisdictions (in Scotland and in Italy) but the architecture and methods are general across similar jurisdictions.",

Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.",

The survey provides much needed demographic information about the education, field, gender, job satisfaction and career plans of the people of RSEs. The community is found to be highly educated, derive mainly from the hard sciences, and to be predominantly male. Respondents report satisfaction in their jobs, but indicate that career progression is both difficult and opaque.This paper supports a continued discussion about the experience of RSEs and recommends further investigation into this important community.",

We show that the coupling between hydrodynamics and short-range repulsive interactions between the swimmer and the surface can lead to hydrodynamic trapping of both pushers and pullers at the wall, and to hydrodynamic oscillations in the case of a pusher. We further show that a pusher moves significantly faster when close to a surface than in the bulk, whereas a puller undergoes a transition between fast motion and a dynamical standstill according to the range of the repulsive interaction. Our results critically require near-field hydrodynamics and demonstrate that far-field hydrodynamics is insufficient to give even a qualitatively correct account of swimmer behaviour near walls. Finally our simulations suggest that it should be possible to control the density and speed of squirmers at a surface by tuning the range of steric and electrostatic swimmer\u2013wall interactions.",

        "abstract": "According to dual processing theory there are two types, or modes, of thinking: system 1, which involves intuitive and nonreflective thinking, and system 2, which is more deliberate and requires conscious effort and thought. The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) is a widely used and robust three item instrument that measures the tendency to override system 1 thinking and to engage in reflective, system 2 thinking. Each item on the CRT has an intuitive (but wrong) answer that must be rejected in order to answer the item correctly. We therefore hypothesized that performance on the CRT may give useful insights into the cognitive processes involved in learning physics, where success involves rejecting the common, intuitive ideas about the world (often called misconceptions) and instead carefully applying physical concepts. This paper presents initial results from an ongoing study examining the relationship between students' CRT scores and their performance on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), which tests students' understanding of Newtonian mechanics. We find that a higher CRT score predicts a higher FCI score for both precourse and postcourse tests. However, we also find that the FCI normalized gain is independent of CRT score. The implications of these results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Interactive engagement activities are increasingly common in undergraduate physics teaching. As research efforts move beyond simply showing that interactive engagement pedagogies work towards developing an understanding of how they lead to improved learning outcomes, a detailed analysis of the way in which these activities are used in practice is needed. Our aim in this paper is to present a characterization of the type and duration of interactions, as experienced by students, that took place during two introductory physics courses (1A and 1B) at a university in the United Kingdom. Through this work, a simple framework for analyzing lectures-the framework for interactive learning in lectures (FILL), which focuses on student interactions (with the lecturer, with each other, and with the material) is proposed. The pedagogical approach is based on Peer Instruction (PI) and both courses are taught by the same lecturer. We find lecture activities can be categorized into three types: interactive (25%), vicarious interactive (20%) (involving questions to and from the lecturer), and noninteractive (55%). As expected, the majority of both interactive and vicarious interactive activities took place during PI. However, the way that interactive activities were used during non-PI sections of the lecture varied significantly between the two courses. Differences were also found in the average time spent on lecturer-student interactions (28% for 1A and 12% for 1B), although not on student-student interactions (12% and 12%) or on individual learning (10% and 7%). These results are explored in detail and the implications for future research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Modern production Molecular Dynamics codes represent a significant investment of effort by the community to develop highly optimised force evaluation routines able to take advantage of state-of-the art hardware such as GPUs and multi-core CPUs. However, this comes at a cost of code complexity which makes it hard for new integration algorithms to be implemented in these packages. This creates a catch-22 for algorithm developement - if new algorithms cannot be implemented and tested in production codes it may be impossible to demonstrate their benefits over existing schemes; conversely, if the community cannot see the benefit of new algorithms, code developers will not spent time implementing them!The Molecular Integration Simulation Toolkit (MIST) library is a solution to this problem by providing plug-ins to existing optimised MD codes, coupled with a simple interface for the development of new integration methods. MIST currently provides interfaces to GROMACS, Amber and NAMD-Lite, allowing it to benefit from OpenMP and GPU acceleration for force-evaluation. Several standard (Verlet, Leapfrog) and new (Langevin Dynamics based on a BAOAB splitting) integrators have been implemented to date. The MIST library interface results in significant ease-of-development, at negligible loss of performance. New integration algorithms are implemented once, in a code-agnostic manner, and can then be immediately deployed in all the MD codes supported by MIST.As well as algorithms for sampling the canonical and micro-canonical ensembles, MIST is also a platform for building more advanced schemes. For example, we have implemented an extended-system method for 'Continuous Tempering', which enables computation of free energy maps in systems with large energy barriers.Several new features are under development in MIST - new constraint solvers for extremely long timesteps and multi-timestep splittings, MPI parallelisation, and support for more MD codes. We welcome the community's input on direction for future development.",

        "abstract": "Linear algebraic techniques are widely used in scientific computing, often requir- ing large-scale parallel resources such as those provided by the ARCHER service. Libraries exist to facilitate the development of appropriate parallel software, but use of these involves intricacies in decomposition of the problem, managing parallel in- put and output, passing messages and the execution of the linear algebra operations themselves. In this paper a relatively simple application, Invertastic, is presented. This is designed to perform a real operation: the inversion of a dense symmetric positive definite matrix using multiple processors in parallel. The inversion of ar- bitrarily large matrices is demonstrated, with the only constraint being the size of compute resource available. Inversion cost is known to have O(N3) complexity, which the results confirm allowing for some parallel communication overhead. In- version of a 2,097,152 x 2,097,152 matrix (of size 32TB) took 6.4 hours on 2,048 compute nodes (49,152 cores). The Invertastic software is freely available online and installed as a central package on ARCHER. It can be used directly (e.g. for genomic studies where the matrix represents the genetic relationships between mul- tiple individuals), or instead as a reference or template for the development of more complex algorithms.",

These combine the familiarity of Python programming with the scalability of workflows. Data streaming is used to gain performance, rapid prototyping and applicability to live observations. dispel4py enables scientists to focus on their scientific goals, avoiding distracting details and retaining flexibility over the computing infrastructure they use. The implementation, therefore, has to map dispel4py abstract workflows optimally onto target platforms chosen dynamically. We present four dispel4py mappings: Apache Storm, MPI, multi-threading and sequential, showing two major benefits: a) smooth transitions from local development on a laptop to scalable execution for production work, and b) scalable enactment on significantly different distributed computing infrastructures. Three application domains are reported and measurements on multiple infrastructures show the optimisations achieved; they have provided demanding real applications and helped us develop effective training. The dispel4py.org is an open-source project to which we invite participation. The effective mapping of dispel4py onto multiple target infrastructures demonstrates exploitation of data-intensive and HPC architectures and consistent scalability.",

Energy efficiency is a hot-topic in HPC and methods to reduce the energy consumption of large machines are an active area of research. In this paper, we examine the energy efficiency and runtime performance of the SBLI and Nektar++ codes, using small but real-world test cases. The codes are instrumented in sufficient detail to reveal significant variability in energy usage during the course of the simulations. In addition, the test cases are run at different CPU frequencies and the consequences of changing this parameter, for both runtime performance (time to solution) and power performance (energy to solution) are presented.",

How- ever, the workload of many important scientific applications is constructed out of spatially and temporally heterogeneous tasks that are often dynamically inter-related. These workloads can benefit from being executed at scale on HPC resources, but a tension exists between the workloads\u2019 resource utilization requirements and the capabilities of the HPC system software and usage policies. Pilot systems have the potential to relieve this tension. RADICAL-Pilot is a scalable and portable pilot system that enables the execution of such diverse workloads. In this paper we describe the design and characterize the performance of its RADICAL-Pilot\u2019s scheduling and executing components on Crays, which are engineered for efficient resource utilization while maintaining the full generality of the Pilot abstraction. We will discuss four different imple- mentations of support for RADICAL-Pilot on Cray systems and analyze and report on their performance.",

        "abstract": "Bicontinuous Pickering emulsions (bijels) are a physically interesting class of soft materials with many potential applications including catalysis, microfluidics and tissue engineering.  They are created by arresting the spinodal decomposition of a partially-miscible liquid with a (jammed) layer of interfacial colloids.  Porosity L (average interfacial separation) of the bijel is controlled by varying the radius (r) and volume fraction (f) of the colloids (L ~ r/f).  However, to optimize the bijel structure with respect to other parameters, e.g. quench rate, characterizing by L alone is insufficient.  Hence, we have used confocal microscopy and X-ray CT to characterize a range of bijels in terms of local and area-averaged interfacial curvatures; we further demonstrate that bijels are bicontinuous using an image-analysis technique known as `region growing'.  In addition, the curvatures of bijels have been monitored as a function of time, which has revealed an intriguing evolution up to 60 minutes after bijel formation, contrary to previous understanding.",

We ported a LU factorisation algorithm, which utilizes the Gaussian elimination method to perform the decomposition, using Intel LEO directives, OpenMP 4.0 directives, Intel's Cilk array notation, and vectorisation directives. We compare the performance achieved with these different methods, investigate the cost of data transfer on the overall time to solution, and analyse the impact of these optimization and parallelisation techniques on code running on the host processors as well. The results show that performance can be improved on the Xeon Phi by optimising the memory operations, and that Cilk array notation can benefit this benchmark on standard processors but do not have the same impact on the Xeon Phi co-processor. We have also demonstrated cases where the Xeon Phi will compute our implementations faster than we can run them on a node of a HPC system, and that our implementations are not as efficient as the LU factorisation implemented in the mkl library.",

In this paper we demonstrate that high level programming and high performance GPU execution for sparse, irregular problems are not mutually exclusive. Our insight is that this can be achieved by capturing sparsity and irregularity friendly implementations within the target space of a pattern-oriented, high-level compilation and transformation system. By working in a language rather than a library, we benefit from the ability to generate implementations by program-specific composition of building blocks which capture detailed, low-level implementation choices. Using sparse matrix-vector multiplication as a case study, we show that the resulting system produces implementations for which the performance is competitive with, and sometimes outperforms that obtained with leading ad-hoc approaches. We show that there are correlations between good implementation choices and simple measurable properties of the irregularity present in problem instances. These can be used to design heuristics which navigate the implementation space effectively.In a case study, we implement a number of versions of sparse matrix-vector multiplication, and achieve promising preliminary performance results. On very regular sparse matrices we are able to achieve up to 1.8x the performance of the state-of-the-art sparse matrix-vector implementation from the clSPARSE libray, and up to 0.7x the performance on very irregular applications.",

Users have control over the instrument configuration as well as player parameters such as mouth pressure, lip dynamics and valve depressions which can be varied over the duration of a gesture. This article introduces the model used in the environment, the development of code from prototyping in MATLAB and optimisation in C and then incorporation of the executable file in the Soundloom interface of the Composers Desktop project. Planned additions to the environment are then discussed. The environment binaries are available to download online along with example sounds and input files.",

        "abstract": "Purpose\u2013 China is the world\u2019s largest user market for digital technologies and experiencing unprecedented rates of rural-urban migration set to create the world\u2019s first \u201curban billion\u201d. This is an important context for studying nuanced adoption behaviours that define a digital divide. Large-scale studies are required to determine what behaviours exist in such populations, but can offer limited ability to draw inferences about why. The purpose of this paper is to report a large-scale study inside China that probes a nuanced \u201cdigital divide\u201d behaviour: consumer demographics indicating ability to pay by electronic means but behaviour suggesting lack of willingness to do so, and extends current demographics to help explain this.Design/methodology/approach\u2013 The authors report trans-national access to commercial \u201cBig Data\u201d inside China capturing the demographics and consumption of millions of consumers across a wide range of physical and digital market channels. Focusing on one urban location we combine traditional demographics with a new measure that reflecting migration: \u201cDistance from Home\u201d, and use data-mining techniques to develop a model that predicts use behaviour.Findings\u2013 Use behaviour is predictable. Most use is explained by value of the transaction. \u201cDistance from Home\u201d is more predictive of technology use than traditional demographics.Research limitations/implications\u2013 Results suggest traditional demographics are insufficient to explain \u201cwhy\u201d use/non-use occurs and hence an insufficient basis to formulate and target government policy.Originality/value\u2013 The authors understand this to be the first large-scale trans-national study of use/non-use of digital channels within China, and the first study of the impact of distance on ICT adoption.",

Recent developments to the code are discussed which improve the performance of the solvers and I/O by using the PETSc and NetCDF libraries respectively. Usability and functionality improvements enabled by code refactoring and merging of a separate OpenMP-parallelized version are also outlined. The overall scaling behaviour of the code is measured, and good strong scaling up to 1152 cores is observed for a 5.6 million element grid. A comparison is made between the legacy serial text-formatted I/O and new NetCDF implementations, showing speedups of up to 17x. Finally, we explore the effects of output file striping on the Lustre parallel file system on ARCHER, a Cray XC30 supercomputer, finding performance gains of up to 12% over the default striping settings.",

Large scale production simulation codes present a challenge for optimisation on any platform, and can be even more problematic for accelerator hardware as the codes contain language operations or functionality that are hard to get good performance from on novel hardware. We present the challenges we have experienced porting two large FORTRAN production codes: GS2 and CP2K. We discuss the strategies, which have proven useful or otherwise, for obtaining good performance on Xeon Phi. We also discuss the reasons why achieving good performance for large-scale codes is problematic.",

At a ner-grained level, each core contains a vector unit allowing multiple integer or oating point calculations to be performed with a single instruction. Additionally, GPU hardware is highly parallel and performsbest when processing large numbers of independent threads. At the same time, tools such as CUDA have become steadily more abundant and mature, allowing more of this parallelism to be exploited.In this paper we describe the process of optimising a physical modelling sound synthesis code, the Multiplate 3D code, which models the acoustic response of a number of metal plates embedded within a box of air. This code presented a number of challenges and no single optimisation technique was applicable to all of these. However, by exploiting parallelism at several dierent levels (multithreading, GPU acceleration, and vectorisation), as well as applying other optimisations, it was possible to speed up the  simulation very signicantly.",

To address this problem in the context of complex traits analysis, we present DISSECT. DISSECT is a new and freely available software that is able to exploit the distributed-memory parallel computational architectures of compute clusters, to perform a wide range of genomic and epidemiologic analyses, which currently can only be carried out on reduced sample sizes or under restricted conditions. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new tool by addressing the challenge of predicting phenotypes from genotype data in human populations using mixed-linear model analysis. We analyse simulated traits from 470,000 individuals genotyped for 590,004 SNPs in \u223c4\u2009h using the combined computational power of 8,400 processor cores. We find that prediction accuracies in excess of 80% of the theoretical maximum could be achieved with large sample sizes.",

        "abstract": "Stencil operations are often a key component when performing acoustics simulations, for which the specific choice of implementation can have a significant effect on both accuracy and computational performance. This paper presents a detailed investigation of computational performance for GPU-based stencil operations in two-step finite difference schemes, using stencils of varying shape and size (ranging from seven to more than 450 points insize). Using an Nvidia K20 GPU, it is found that as the stencil size increases, compute times increase less than that naively expected by considering only the number of computational operations involved, because performance is instead determined by data transfer times throughout the GPU memory architecture. With regards to the effects of stencil shape, performance obtained with stencils that are compact in space is mainly due to efficient use of the read-only data (texture) cache on the K20, and performance obtained with standard high-order stencils is due to increased memory bandwidth usage, compensating for lower cache hit rates. Also in this study, a brief comparison is made with performance results from a related, recent study that used a shared memory approach on a GTX 670 GPU device. It is found that by making efficient use of a GTX 660Ti GPU\u2014whose computational performance is generally lower than that of a GTX 670\u2014similar or better performance to those results can be achieved without the use of shared memory.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the complex, transcriptional feedback loops in the circadian clock mechanism has depended upon quantitative, timeseries data from disparate sources. We measure clock gene RNA profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, grown with or without exogenous sucrose, or in soil-grown plants and in wild-type and mutant backgrounds. The RNA profiles were strikingly robust across the experimental conditions, so current mathematical models are likely to be broadly applicable in leaf tissue. In addition to providing reference data, unexpected behaviours included co-expression of PRR9 and ELF4, and regulation of PRR5 by GI. Absolute RNA quantification revealed low levels of PRR9 transcripts (peak approx. 50 copies cell(-1)) compared with other clock genes, and threefold higher levels of LHY RNA (more than 1500 copies cell(-1)) than of its close relative CCA1. The data are disseminated from BioDare, an online repository for focused timeseries data, which is expected to benefit mechanistic modelling. One data subset successfully constrained clock gene expression in a complex model, using publicly available software on parallel computers, without expert tuning or programming. We outline the empirical and mathematical justification for data aggregation in understanding highly interconnected, dynamic networks such as the clock, and the observed design constraints on the resources required to make this approach widely accessible.",

        "abstract": "Chalky microporosity can constitute up to 100% of the total porosity within carbonate reservoirs, but its contribution to both single- and multi-phase flow is poorly quantified. We present a flexible, object-based algorithm to construct 3D computational rock representations that reproduce micritic fabrics of chalky microporous carbonates based on calcite crystal fabrics observed in 2D SEM images. By methodologically altering model parameters we begin to explore the state-space of microporous carbonates to quantify single- and multi-phase flow using both lattice-Boltzmann and network flow models.Micropore size has little to no effect on single-phase permeability, while differences in multi-phase flow properties are observed for microporous fabrics with pores no smaller than 0.50\u03bcm3 suggesting a change in the pore-scale controls on flow. Single-phase permeability increases by an order of magnitude within fabrics of varying total microporosity (18% to 35%), but minimal effect on multi-phase flow is observed. Similarly, multi-phase flow properties are unaltered by micrite rounding due to burial dissolution, suggesting no alteration in pore-network topology. Micrite rounding, however, notably increases porosity and single-phase permeability in comparison to original rhombic micrite fabrics. The presence of moldic mesopores impacts flow but only when there is a direct connection between them. Otherwise, single-phase permeability is controlled bymicropores. Importantly, recovery is dependent on wetting scenario and pore-network homogeneity. Under water-wet imbibition, an increase in pore homogeneity (more micropores) yields a lower residual oil saturation. Together, these results quantify the importance of microporosity in contributing to, or controlling, overall flow and sweep characteristics in carbonate reservoirs.",

Nek5000 is a computational fluid dynamics code based on the spectral element method used for the simulation of incompressible flow. The original NekBone Fortran source code has been used as the base and enhanced by OpenACC directives. The profiling of NekBone provided an assessment of the suitability of the code for GPU systems, and indicated possible kernel optimizations. To port NekBone to GPU systems required little effort and a small number of additional lines of code (approximately one OpenACC directive per 1000 lines of code). The na\u00efve implementation using OpenACC leads to little performance improvement: on a single node, from 16 Gflops obtained with the version without OpenACC, we reached 20 Gflops with the na\u00efve OpenACC implementation. An optimized NekBone version leads to a 43 Gflop performance on a single node. In addition, we ported and optimized NekBone to parallel GPU systems, reaching a parallel efficiency of 79.9% on 1024 GPUs of the Titan XK7 supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.",

        "abstract": "Large Eddy Simulation is a critical modelling tool for scien- tists investigating atmospheric flows, turbulence and cloud microphysics. Within the UK, the principal LES model used by the atmospheric research community is the Met Office Large Eddy Model (LEM). The LEM was originally devel- oped in the late 1980s using computational techniques and assumptions of the time, which means that the it does not scale beyond 512 cores. In this paper we present the Met Office NERC Cloud model, MONC, which is a re-write of the existing LEM. We discuss the software engineering and architectural decisions made in order to develop a flexible, extensible model which the community can easily customise for their own needs. The scalability of MONC is evaluated, along with numerous additional customisations made to fur- ther improve performance at large core counts. The result of this work is a model which delivers to the community signifi- cant new scientific modelling capability that takes advantage of the current and future generation HPC machines.",

We describe our methodology in augmenting the original central processing unit (CPU) version with GPU functionality in a maintainable fashion. We present several optimisations that maximise performance on the GPU architecture through tuning for the GPU memory hierarchy. We describe how we implement particles within the fluid in such a way to avoid a major diversion of the CPU and GPU codebases, whilst minimising data transfer at each time step. We detail our halo-exchange communication phase for the code, which exploits overlapping to allow efficient parallel scaling to many GPUs. We present results showing that the application demonstrates excellent scaling to at least 8192 GPUs in parallel, the largest system tested at the time of writing. The GPU version (on NVIDIA K20X GPUs) is around 3.5\u20135 times faster that the CPU version (on fully utilised AMD Opteron 6274 16-core CPUs), comparing equal numbers of CPUs and GPUs. ",

        "abstract": "One of the foundations of the scientific method is to be able to reproduce experiments and corroborate the results of research that has been done before. However, with the increasing complexities of new technologies and techniques, coupled with the specialisation of experiments, reproducing research findings has become a growing challenge. Clearly, scientific methods must be conveyed succinctly, and with clarity and rigour, in order for research to be reproducible. Here, we propose steps to help increase the transparency of the scientific method and the reproducibility of research results: specifically, we introduce a peer-review oath and accompanying manifesto. These have been designed to offer guidelines to enable reviewers (with the minimum friction or bias) to follow and apply open science principles, and support the ideas of transparency, reproducibility and ultimately greater societal impact. Introducing the oath and manifesto at the stage of peer review will help to check that the research being published includes everything that other researchers would need to successfully repeat the work. Peer review is the lynchpin of the publishing system: encouraging the community to consciously (and conscientiously) uphold these principles should help to improve published papers, increase confidence in the reproducibility of the work and, ultimately, provide strategic benefits to authors and their institutions.",

In this article, the successes and limitations of biomolecular simulation and the further developments that are likely in the near future are discussed. A brief overview is also provided of the experimental biophysical methods that are commonly used to probe biomolecular structure and dynamics, and the accuracy of the information that can be obtained from each is compared with that from modelling. It is concluded that progress towards an accurate spatial and temporal model of biomacromolecules requires a combination of all of these biophysical techniques, both experimental and computational.",

        "abstract": "Large Eddy Simulation is a critical modelling tool for the investigation of atmospheric flows, turbulence and cloud microphysics. The models used by the UK atmospheric research community are homogeneous and the latest model, MONC, is designed to run on substantial HPC systems with very high CPU core counts. In order to future proof these codes it is worth investigating other technologies and architectures which might support the communities running their codes at the exa-scale.In this paper we present a hybrid version of MONC, where the most computationally intensive aspect is offloaded to the GPU while the rest of the functionality runs concurrently on the CPU. Developed using the directive driven OpenACC, we consider the suitability and maturity of this technology to modern Fortran scientific codes as well general software engineering techniques which aid this type of porting work. The performance of our hybrid model at scale is compared against the CPU version before considering other tuning options and making a comparison between the energy usage of the homo- and hetero-geneous versions. The result of this work is a promising hybrid model that shows performance benefits of our approach when the GPU has a significant computational workload which can not only be applied to the MONC model but also other weather and climate simulations in use by the community.",

However, the complexity of their architectures and the impenetrable structure of some large applications makes the hand-tuning algorithms process more challenging and unproductive. On the contrary, auto-tuning technology has appeared as a solution to this problems since it can address the inherent complexity of the latest and future computer architectures. By auto-tuning, an application may be optimised for a target platform by making automated optimal choices. To exploit this technology on modern GPUs, we have created an auto-tuned version of Nek5000 based on OpenACC directives which has demonstrated to obtained improved results over a hand-tune optimised version of the same computation kernels. This paper focuses on a particular role for auto-tuning Nek5000 to utilise a massively parallel GPU accelerated system based on OpenACC directive to adapt the Nek5000 code for the Exascale computation.",

        "abstract": "The major challenges caused by the increasing scale and complexity of the current petascale and the future exascale systems are cross-cutting concerns of the whole software ecosystem. The trend for compute nodes is towards greater numbers of lower power cores, with a decreasing memory to core ratio. This is imposing a strong evolutionary pressure on numerical algorithms and software to efficiently utilise the available memory and network bandwidth. Unstructured finite elements codes have been effectively parallelised using domain decomposition methods, implemented using libraries such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for a long time. However, there are many algorithmic and implementation optimisation opportunities when threading is used for intra-node parallelisation for the latest multi-core/many-core platforms. The benefits include reduced memory requirements, cache sharing, reduced number of partitions and less MPI communication. While OpenMP is promoted as being easy to use and allows incremental parallelisation of codes, naive implementations frequently yield poor performance. In practice, as with MPI, the same care and attention should be exercised over algorithm and hardware details when programming with OpenMP. In this paper, we report progress in implementing a hybrid OpenMP-MPI version of the unstructured finite element application Fluidity. In the matrix assembly kernels, the OpenMP parallel algorithm uses graph colouring to identify independent sets of elements that can be assembled simultaneously with no race conditions. The sparse linear systems defined by various equations are solved using threaded PETSc and HYPRE which is utilised as a threaded preconditioner through the PETSc interface. Since unstructured finite element codes are well known to be memory bound, particular attention is paid to ccNUMA architectures where data locality is particularly important to achieve good intra-node scaling characteristics. We also demonstrate that utilising non-blocking algorithm and libraries are critical to mixed-mode application so that it can achieve better parallel performance than the pure MPI version.",

The matrix-matrix multiplication, the Nek5000 gather-scatter operator and a preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver have implemented using OpenACC for multi-GPU systems.We report an speed-up of 1.3 on single node of a Cray XK6 when using OpenACC directives in Nek5000. On 512 nodes of the Titan supercomputer, the speed-up can be approached to 1.4.

After almost 4 years collaboration between EPCC and AWE, we present Chimaera-2_3D: a Fortran90 and MPI/OpenMP code which scales well to thousands of cores for large problem sizes. Significant restructuring has increased the degrees of parallelism available to efficiently exploit future many-core exascale systems. For OpenMP, we have introduced slices through the cuboid mesh which present a set of cells which may be computed independently; and computation over the angles within each cell can also be parallelized using OpenMP. Previously, the initial form of Chimaera computed a coupled, inter-dependent iteration over 'Energy Groups'. Our new code now decouples these iterations which, whilst increasing the computational time, permits a new task level of efficient parallelism encoded using MPI. This paper will present results from the extensive benchmarking exercise using a Cray XT4/5 (HECToR) and a Cray XC30 (ARCHER).Wa",

The project has discovered over 60 new million-digit primes, as well as record sized twin and Sophie Germain primes. This paper will present a history of the project, the algorithms and software used by PrimeGrid and how the BOINC distributed computing architecture is used to harness tens of thousands of computers. We also highlight some recent results from several current prime search sub-projects.",

        "abstract": "The HPC community have set themselves the target of reaching exa-scale performance by 2020. It is not a question of whether this target will be met, but instead whether or not an exa-scale machine can be programmed and used effectively to perform science at a scale never before attainable. There are many challenges in many different areas to overcome if the community are to scale their current scientific codes up to the exa-flop level and one of the approaches to solving this is through the use of co-design, where interdisciplinary teams work together to solve a specific problem.However this development methodology is still relatively immature and in this report we gather the opinions of co-design from those in the HPC field, consider the positive and negative impact of such an approach, survey how co-design is currently being used and make some recommendations about how European projects might more effectively take advantage of this methodology to help solve the exa-scale challenge.",

This paper presents the motivation for\nbuilding such systems, it reviews how solid-Earth scientists can\nmake significant research progress using them and explains\nthe architecture and mechanisms that make their construction\nand operation achievable. We conclude with a summary of\nthe achievements to date and identify the crucial steps needed\nto extend the capabilities for seismologists, for solid-Earth\nscientists and for similar disciplines.",

        "abstract": "Peer Instruction (PI) is an evidence based pedagogy commonly used in undergraduate physics instruction. When asked questions designed to test conceptual understanding, it has been observed that the proportion of students choosing the correct answer increases following peer discussion; however, relatively little is known about what takes place during these discussions or how they are beneficial to the processes of learning physics [M. C. James and S. Willoughby, Am. J. Phys. 79, 123 (2011)]. In this paper a framework for analyzing PI discussions developed through the lens of the \"resources model\" [D. Hammer, Am. J. Phys. 64, 1316 (1996); D. Hammer et al., Information Age Publishing (2005)] is proposed. A central hypothesis for this framework is that the dialogue with peers plays a crucial role in activating appropriate cognitive resources, enabling the students to see the problem differently, and therefore to answer the questions correctly. This framework is used to gain greater insights into the PI discussions of first year undergraduate physics students at the University of Edinburgh, UK, which were recorded using Livescribe Smartpens. Analysis of the dialogues revealed three different types of resource activation corresponding to increasing cognitive grain size. These were activation of knowledge elements, activation of linkages between knowledge elements, and activation of control structures (epistemic games and epistemological frames). Three case studies are examined to illustrate the role that peer dialogue plays in the activation of these cognitive resources in a PI session. The implications for pedagogical practice are discussed.",

The main aim of dispel4py is to enable scientists to focus on their computation instead of being distracted by details of the computing infrastructure they use. Therefore, special care has been taken to provide dispel4py with the ability to map abstract workflows to different enactment platforms dynamically, at run time. In this work we present four dispel4py mappings: Apache Storm, MPI, multi-threading and sequential. The results show that dispel4py is successful in enacting on different platforms, while also providing scalable performance.",

        "abstract": "Fossil fuel power generation and other industrial emissions of carbon dioxide are a threat to global climate, yet many economies will remain reliant on these technologies for several decades. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in deep geological formations provides an effective option to remove these emissions from the climate system. In many regions storage reservoirs are located offshore, over a kilometre or more below societally important shelf seas. Therefore, concerns about the possibility of leakage and potential environmental impacts, along with economics, have contributed to delaying development of operational CCS. Here we investigate the detectability and environmental impact of leakage from a controlled sub-seabed release of CO2 . We show that the biological impact and footprint of this small leak analogue (<1 tonne CO2 d \u00e2 '1) is confined to a few tens of metres. Migration of CO2 through the shallow seabed is influenced by near-surface sediment structure, and by dissolution and re-precipitation of calcium carbonate naturally present in sediments. Results reported here advance the understanding of environmental sensitivity to leakage and identify appropriate monitoring strategies for full-scale carbon storage operations.",

We further demonstrate that the technology can be used to optimize existing protocols in order to substitute costly growth factors with bioactive small molecules and/or increase cell yield, and to identify in vitro conditions for the production of rare developmental intermediates such as an embryonic lymphoid progenitor cell that has not previously been reported.",

In this paper, various modular physical modeling design environments, based on the use of time stepping methods such as finite difference time domain methods are described, with an emphasis on the underlying computational behaviour of such methods, both in the run-time loop and in precomputation. As such methods are computationally intensive, additional emphasis is placed on issues surrounding parallelisation, and implementation in highly parallel hardware such as graphics processing units. This paper is paired with a recently completed multichannel piece, and the composer's perspective on working with such environments is also addressed. ",

As well as the \u201ctraditional\u201d use of software for modelling and simulation, it is used to manage and control instruments, and analyse and visualise data. This permeation of the use of software into the mainstream of research across all disciplines has meant that it is increasingly difficult to reproduce and reuse the work of other researchers. The reproducible research principle requires the full computational environment to be published as well as the paper where the results are reported. This raises the question of whether the current data management policies and infrastructure provided by universities such as Edinburgh are capable of handling software as a digital research output through its lifecycle.",

This paper looks at the concept of software reusability from the perspective of the software engineer and the researcher. It proposes a multi-level framework for improving the reusability of scientific software, which minimises the information and effort required such that it is easier for scientific software developers, who are often researchers, to provide appropriate levels of information to support reuse.",

Many projects (including parallelisation efforts of the R core) offer R packages and functions that allow programming of solutions for large-scale analysis problems. However, these usually require familiarity with HPC programming as well as sufficient and funded time to employ, which is feasible for one-off analysis problems but impractical for common analysis methods.To make High Performance Computing (HPC) solutions available to R users without HPC experience, we started development on the SPRINT package in 2008. It allows these users straightforward use of already implemented parallelised versions of many relevant R functions on multi-core Macs as well as large-scale clusters/HPC platforms like the UK\u2019s HECToR or ARCHER (we have also tested on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud). In addition to addressing speed-critical problems, we also address memory-critical problems.We will here introduce recent upgrades to SPRINT, discuss for regular R users how to use SPRINT and for users with HPC background how our parallelisation strategies are particularly aimed at problems that go beyond \u2018simple\u2019 task farming. We outline case examples for use of SPRINT as well as performance and limitations of our approach in context of biological high-throughput data (although most individual functions are generically usable for other larger data sets).Based on our needs and those we established in R user surveys, we currently support parallelised versions [1] of original [2] functions (our function names add prefix \u2018p\u2019, apart from pmaxt, which is based on mt.maxT) that are essential in clustering, classification and non-parametric statistics when applied to very large data sets: pstringdistmatrix, pboot, papply, pcor, ppam, prandomForest, pmaxt, pRP, psvm.References[1] Publications of our function implementations can be found on www.r-sprint.org -> Publications[2] Source citations for these packages can be found on www.r-sprint.org -> Overview and R functions",

A combination of Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire analysis (both modal and non-modal) with direct numerical simulation of the three-dimensional two-phase Navier-Stokes equations is used. For the parameter regimes under consideration, under linear theory, the most unstable waves are two-dimensional. Nevertheless, we demonstrate several mechanisms whereby three-dimensional waves enter the system, and dominate at late time. There exists a direct route, whereby three-dimensional waves are amplified by the standard linear mechanism; for certain parameter classes, such waves grow at a rate less than but comparable to that of the most dangerous two-dimensional mode. Additionally, there is a weakly nonlinear route, whereby a purely spanwise wave grows according to transient linear theory and subsequently couples to a streamwise mode in weakly nonlinear fashion. Consideration is also given to the ultimate state of these waves: persistent three-dimensional nonlinear waves are stretched and distorted by the base flow, thereby producing regimes of ligaments, 'sheets' or 'interfacial turbulence'. Depending on the parameter regime, these regimes are observed either in isolation, or acting together.",

In a periodic 'blue phase' host, particles should template into colloidal crystals with potential uses in photonics, metamaterials and transformational optics. Here we show by computer simulation that colloid/cholesteric mixtures can give rise to regular crystals, glasses, percolating gels, isolated clusters, twisted rings and undulating colloidal ropes. This structure can be tuned via particle concentration, and by varying the surface interactions of the cholesteric host with both the particles and confining walls. Many of these new materials are metastable: two or more structures can arise under identical thermodynamic conditions. The observed structure depends not only on the formulation protocol but also on the history of an applied electric field. This new class of soft materials should thus be relevant to design of switchable, multistable devices for optical technologies such as smart glass and e-paper. ",

Flow is known to be a key determinant of the timescales and pathways of the switching kinetics. Incorporating hydrodynamic effects into theories for liquid crystal devices is therefore important; however this is also highly non-trivial, and typically requires the use of accurate numerical methods. Here, we review some recent advances in our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of switching in liquid crystal devices, mainly gained through computer simulations. These results, as we shall show, uncover interesting new physics, and may be important for future applications. ",

        "abstract": "Network performance in terms of throughput, latency, packet loss or jitter significantly influences user's quality of experience of cloud applications. Network services impact on cloud applications performance and this impact is even more significant when the cloud infrastructure spreads over different administrative domains, such as in a federated cloud or hybrid-cloud scenarios. Given this strong coupling between cloud application performance and network performance there is great value to be gained by supporting advanced controlled networking functionalities between distributed cloud infrastructures. These functionalities would be useful to the Future Internet (FI) experimentation community as well as future production clouds. This paper describes an architecture and a set of procedures to interconnect a multi-cloud environment with advanced facilities for controlled networking. This integration allows the provisioning of customized network functions and services in support of experiments running in a multi-cloud test-bed. The possibility to control the network connectivity is a key feature to provide better performance for the experimenters' cloud applications. We focus on the details of federating three advanced networking facilities with the BonFIRE multi-cloud environment. These three networking facilities are: FEDERICA, which supports controlled routing; G\u00c9ANT's Bandwidth-on-Demand service and OFELIA that uses OpenFlow to provide Software Defined Network functionalities. The interconnections with FEDERICA and G\u00c9ANT are already active, while OFELIA is envisaged as future work for a third facility to interconnect.",

In recent times, the quantity of data that can be obtained in experiments has risen significantly, making previously fast analyses time consuming or even not possible at all with the existing software infrastructure. High performance computing (HPC) systems offer a solution to these problems but at the expense of increased complexity for the end user. The Simple Parallel R Interface is a library for R that aims to reduce the complexity of using HPC systems by providing biostatisticians with drop-in parallelised replacements of existing R functions. In this paper we describe parallel implementations of two popular techniques: exploratory clustering analyses using the random forest classifier and feature selection through identification of differentially expressed genes using the rank product method.",

R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing popular with biostatisticians for genomic data analyses. A survey of such R users highlighted its implementation of bootstrapping as a prime candidate for parallelization to overcome computational bottlenecks. The Simple Parallel R Interface (SPRINT) is a package that allows R users to exploit high performance computing in multi-core desktops and supercomputers without expert knowledge of such systems. This paper describes the parallelization of bootstrapping for inclusion in the SPRINT R package. Depending on the complexity of the bootstrap statistic and the number of resamples, this implementation has close to optimal speed up on up to 16 nodes of a supercomputer and close to 100 on 512 nodes. This performance in a multi-node setting compares favourably with an existing parallelization option in the native R implementation of bootstrapping.",

Consisting of more than one million lines of Fortran 95 code, the application is tested for correctness with a set of about 2,500 inputs using a dedicated regression testing environment. CP2K can be built with many compilers and executed on different serial and parallel platforms, thus making comprehensive testing even more challenging. This paper presents an effort to improve the existing testing process of CP2K in order to better support its continuing development. Enhancements have been made to the regression testing environment to support multi-platform testing and a new automated multi-platform testing system has been developed to check the code on a regular basis. Also, tools have been used to gain code coverage information for different test configurations. All the information is aggregated and displayed on the dedicated web page.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between students' use of PeerWise, an online tool that facilitates peer learning through student-generated content in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and achievement, as measured by their performance in the end-of-module examinations, was investigated in 5 large early-years science modules (in physics, chemistry and biology) across 3 research-intensive UK universities. A complex pattern was observed in terms of which type of activity (writing, answering or commenting on questions) was most beneficial for students; however, there was some evidence that students of lower intermediate ability may have gained particular benefit. In all modules, a modest but statistically significant positive correlation was found between students' PeerWise activity and their examination performance, after taking prior ability into account. This suggests that engaging with the production and discussion of student-generated content in the form of MCQs can support student learning in a way that is not critically dependent on course, institution, instructor or student.",

        "abstract": "The advent of globally distributed computing services and network access allows 'big data' on consumption to be used to model, explain and predict consumer behavior at resolutions that range from individual cities to whole countries. Given access to suitable infrastructure, the most significant challenge is to create conditions under which 'Data Scientists' may access and manipulate the required data whilst observing individual, national, and commercial constraints set by the type and location of the data. This paper draws on the experience of building the first Global Computing Grid to connect collaborating sites in three continents and describes the architecture of an embedded analytical facility installed within a Chinese commercial organisation that has enabled collaborative analysis of millions of consumer records. We report how this access has provided new insights into consumer behaviour within China ranging from testing strategic models of economic development to exploring 'digital exclusion' and the impact of migration on technology adoption.",

Whilst using models such as Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) is attractive from a simplicity point of view, the abstractions that these impose upon the programmer can impact performance. We propose an approach, type-oriented programming, where all aspects of parallelism are encoded via types and the type system which allows for the programmer to write simple PGAS data intensive HPC codes and then, if they so wish, tune the fundamental aspects by modifying type information. This paper considers the suitability of using type-oriented programming, with the PGAS memory model, in data intensive workloads. We compare a type-oriented implementation of the Graph500 benchmark against MPI reference implementations both in terms of programmability and performance, and evaluate how orienting their parallel codes around types can assist in the data intensive HPC field.",

It is generally acknowledged by practising actuaries within UK life offices that it is currently impossible to correctly fulfil the requirements imposed by Solvency II using existing computational techniques based on commercially available valuation packages. Our work has already shown that it is possible to perform profitability calculations at a far higher rate than is achievable using commercial packages. One of the key factors in achieving these gains is to calculate reserves using recurrence relations that scale linearly with the number of time steps. Here, we present a general vector recurrence relation which can be used for a wide range of non-unit linked policies that are covered by Solvency II; such contracts include annuities, term assurances, and endowments. Our results suggest that by using an optimised parallel implementation of this algorithm, on an affordable hardware platform, it is possible to perform the 'brute force' approach to demonstrating solvency in a realistic timescale (of the order of a few hours).",

This is achieved by federating geographically distributed, heterogeneous clouds testbeds where each exposes unique configuration and/or features while giving to the experimenters (users) an homogeneous way to interact with the facility. All those testbeds are controlled by a central set of services commonly denominated \"Broker\".

        "abstract": "The trend of all modern computer architectures, and the path to exascale, is towards increasing numbers of lower power cores, with a decreasing memory to core ratio. This imposes a strong evolutionary pressure on algorithms and software to efficiently utilise all levels of parallelism available on a given platform while minimising data movement. Unstructured finite elements codes have long been effectively parallelised using domain decomposition methods, implemented using libraries such as the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, there are many optimisation opportunities when threading is used for intra-node parallelisation for the latest multi-core/many-core platforms. The benefits include increased algorithmic freedom, reduced memory requirements, cache sharing, reduced number of parti- tions, less MPI communication and I/O overhead.In this paper, we report progress in implementing a hybrid OpenMP\u2013MPI version of the unstructured finite element code Fluidity. For matrix assembly kernels, the OpenMP parallel algorithm uses graph colouring to identify independent sets of elements that can be assembled concurrently with no race conditions. In this phase there are no MPI overheads as each MPI process only assembles its own local part of the global matrix. We use an OpenMP threaded fork of PETSc to solve the resulting sparse linear systems of equations. We experiment with a range of preconditioners, including HYPRE which provides the algebraic multigrid preconditioner BoomerAMG where the smoother is also threaded. Since unstruc- tured finite element codes are well known to be memory latency bound, particular attention is paid to ccNUMA architectures where data locality is particularly important to achieve good intra-node scaling characteristics. We also demonstrate that utilising non-blocking algorithms and libraries are critical to mixed-mode application so that it can achieve better parallel performance than the pure MPI version.",

        "abstract": "When significant communication costs arise in the solution of multidimensional problems on parallel computers, optimal performance cannot always be achieved by perfectly balancing the computational load across cores. Modest sacrifices in the computational load balance may facilitate substantial overall performance improvements by achieving large savings in the costs associated with communications. This general approach is illustrated by application to GS2, an initial value gyrokinetic simulation code developed to study low-frequency turbulence in magnetized plasma. GS2 is parallelised using MPI with the simulation domain decomposed across tasks. The optimal domain decomposition is non-trivial, and is complicated by the fact that several domain decompositions are needed and that these do not all optimise at the chosen task count. Application to GS2, of the novel approach outlined in this paper, has improved performance by up to 17% for a representative simulation. Similar strategies may be beneficial in a broader class of problems.",

We present performance analysis of several parallel asynchronous implementations of Jacobi\u2019s method for solving systems of linear equations, using MPI, SHMEM and OpenMP. In particular we have solved systems of over 4 billion unknowns using up to 32,768 processes on a Cray XE6 supercomputer. We show that the precise implementation details of asynchronous algorithms can strongly affect the resulting performance and convergence behaviour of our solvers in unexpected ways, discuss how our specific implementations could be generalised to other classes of problem, and suggest how existing parallel programming models might be extended to allow asynchronous algorithms to be expressed more easily.",

There are many different techniques and algorithms for determining period, all with different assumptions and with differing levels of complexity. Choosing which algorithm, which implementation and which measures of accuracy to use can offer many pitfalls, especially for the non-expert. We have developed the BioDare system, an online service allowing data-sharing (including public dissemination), data-processing and analysis. Circadian experiments are the main focus of BioDare hence performing period analysis is a major feature of the system. Six methods have been incorporated into BioDare: Enright and Lomb-Scargle periodograms, FFT-NLLS, mFourfit, MESA and Spectrum Resampling. Here we review those six techniques, explain the principles behind each algorithm and evaluate their performance. In order to quantify the methods' accuracy, we examine the algorithms against artificial mathematical test signals and model-generated mRNA data. Our re-implementation of each method in Java allows meaningful comparisons of the computational complexity and computing time associated with each algorithm. Finally, we provide guidelines on which algorithms are most appropriate for which data types, and recommendations on experimental design to extract optimal data for analysis.",

Non-users of digital channels have no direct means of signalling preferences through consumption, rendering them effectively invisible to designers of future products and at risk of permanent exclusion.

Separating consumers into digital/non-digital user groups allows the characteristics of those at risk of \u2018digital exclusion\u2019 to be predicted. From a corporate perspective, this scale of analysis allows strategic models of economic development in China based on both City Tier and McKinsey\u2019s City Cluster to be tested, and delivers \u2018at risk\u2019 groups that are large enough to provide economic incentives for inclusion. Non-use may, however, be elective, with consequences for the effectiveness with which governments formulate and target \u2018digital inclusion\u2019 policies. Hence we also explore how elective non-users might be distinguished from the potentially excluded.",

MDMP uses directives to allow users to specify what communications should take place in the code, and then implements those communications in an optimal manner using both the information provided by the user and data collected from instrumenting the code and gathering information on the data to be communicated at runtime. In this paper we outline the basic concepts and functionality of MDMP and discuss the performance that can be achieved using our prototype implementation of MDMP a range of benchmark cases.",

        "abstract": "Reliable aerodynamic and aeroelastic design of wind turbines, aircraft wings and turbomachinery blades increasingly relies on the use of high-fidelity Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics codes to predict the strongly nonlinear periodic flows associated with structural vibrations and periodically vary- ing farfield boundary conditions. On a single computer core, the harmonic balance solution of the Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to significantly reduce the analysis runtime with respect to the conventional time-domain approach. The problem size of realistic simulations, however, requires high- performance computing. The Computational Fluid Dynamics COSA code features a novel harmonic balance Navier-Stokes solver which has been previously parallelised using both a pure MPI implementation and a hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementa- tion. This paper presents the recently completed optimisation of both parallelisations. The achieved performance improvements of both parallelisations highlight the effectiveness of the adopted parallel optimisation strategies. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the optimal performance of these two architectures in terms of runtime and power consumption using some of the current common HPC architectures highlights the reduction of both aspects achievable by using the hybrid parallelisation with emerging many-core architectures.",

One such software package, providing a wide range of functionality required in whole-genome association studies is PLINK. Although, it does not limit the size of the data sets, the time needed to process them is often a bottleneck. This master project was focused on improving the performance of two functionality options: epistasis analysis and haplotype blocks estimation. It has been determined that the g++ compiler and \u2013O2flag provide the optimal performance for both options. The epistasis analysis has been parallelised using OpenMP. The parallel for schedule directive has been used and dynamic schedule with the chunk size of the size 128 provided the best scaling. When executed on 12 threads the epistasis analysis was 10.5 times faster than when executed on 1 thread. Haplotype blocks option has been serially optimised. Introduced optimisations improved the execution time by about 30%.",

As such, for complex systems of the type seen in musical acoustics, simulation can be a computationally costly undertaking, particularly if simplifying hypotheses, such as those of traveling wave or mode decompositions are not employed. In this paper, large scale time stepping methods, such as the \ufb01nite difference time domain and \ufb01nite volume time domain methods are explored for a variety of systems of interest in musical acoustics, including brass instruments, percussion instruments based on thin plate and shell vibration, and also their embeddings in 3D acoustic spaces. Attention is paid here to implementation issues, particularly on parallel hardware, which is well-suited to time stepping methods operating over regular grids. Sound examples are presented.",

        "abstract": "There is a wealth of digital data currently being gathered by commercial and private concerns that could supplement academic research. To unlock this data it is important to gain the trust of the companies that hold the data as well as showing them how they may benefit from this research. Part of this trust is gained through established reputation and the other through the technology used to safeguard the data. This paper discusses how different technology frameworks have been applied to safeguard the data and facilitate collaborative work between commercial concerns and academic institutions. The paper focuses on the distinctive requirements of e-Social Science: access to large-scale data on behaviour in society in environments that impose confidentiality constraints on access. These constraints arise from both privacy concerns and the commercial sensitivities of that data. In particular, the paper draws on the experiences of building an intercontinental Grid\u2013INWA\u2013from its first operation connecting Australia and Scotland to its subsequent extension to China across the Trans-Eurasia Information Network\u2013the first large-scale research and education network for the Asia-Pacific region. This allowed commercial data to be analysed by experts that were geographically distributed across the globe. It also provided an entry point for a major Chinese commercial organization to approve use of a Grid solution in a new collaboration provided the centre of gravity of the data is retained within the jurisdiction of the data owner. We describe why, despite this approval, an embedded solution was eventually adopted. We find that \u2018data sovereignty\u2019 dominates any decision on whether and how to participate in e-Social Science collaborations and how this might impact on a Cloud based solution to this type of collaboration.",

The systems produced vary considerably, but they all face the issue of sustainability, namely how to ensure the continued existence of a resource once the project that created it has finished. This paper addresses the sustainability issues faced by the TextGrid and TEXTvre virtual research environments for textual scholarship, examining the inter-project collaboration and cross-fertilization that took place, and investigating how the projects benefited from this exchange. It also examines how their sustainability is being facilitated by the more general-purpose DARIAH infrastructure, and conversely how their existing collaboration can serve as a model for future collaborations within the DARIAH community.",

        "abstract": "Nickel (Ni) is a known carcinogenic and mutagenic compound and an important contaminant of aquatic environments. Ni toxicity and its potential impact on aquatic organisms are, however, not well understood. This study used an integrated approach to evaluate genotoxic effects, tissue-specific accumulation and transcriptional profiles of key genes in mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, exposed to a range of concentrations of Ni. The genotoxic effects assessed were total and oxidative DNA damage (DNA strand breaks measured using the enzyme modified comet assay), and induction of micronuclei (MN; clastogenic and/or aneugenic effects) using haemocytes as the target cells. Six genes (pgp, mt10, mt20, sod, hsp70 and gst) were selected for transcriptional analysis in the gills based on their key role in the stress response. Following exposure to sublethal concentrations of Ni (0-3600\u03bcgL-1) for 5 days, mussel haemocytes showed significant genotoxicity at >1800\u03bcgL-1 (4-fold increase for DNA strand breaks and 3-fold increase for MN induction). There was no significant difference between buffer (control) and enzyme treatments which target oxidised DNA bases (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase or endonuclease IIII). This suggested that, in haemocytes, oxidative DNA damage is not a major mechanism for Ni-induced genotoxicity. The expression of mt20 and gst genes in gill was up-regulated at genotoxic concentrations, whilst pgp expression was markedly up-regulated, particularly at 18\u03bcgL-1 Ni (19-fold increase). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed significant associations between % tail DNA and MN induction in haemocytes (r=0.88, p<0.05), and between Ni accumulation in foot (r=0.47, p<0.05) and digestive gland (r=0.41, p<0.05) and induction of MN in the haemocytes. Our results are the first to suggest that Ni-induced genotoxicity in mussel haemocytes may not be a result of oxidative DNA damage, and that multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) may play an important role in Ni detoxification in this species.",

For a weak anchoring strength W of the director field at the colloidal surface, this creates a template, favoring particle positions either on top of or midway between defect lines, depending on alpha = R/p. For small alpha, optical microscopy experiments confirm this picture, but for larger alpha no templating is seen. This may stem from the emergence at moderate W of a rugged energy landscape associated with defect reconnections.",

DISPEL is a powerful programming language, while at the same time providing a high level of abstraction to ease the development of data-intensive applications. Much of the complexity and detail of a computation is embedded in the processing elements (PEs) themselves, which are created by specialists in their own domains. DISPEL functions and the registry provide further capabilities to abstract development for the user\u2014 for example, a function may encapsulate a complex composition of other constructs so that the resulting PE(s) can be directly used without knowledge of their underlying structure. The registry, empowered by the structural and domain type system, provides the ability to validate a DISPEL script in terms of more than simple syntax and provides a wealth of opportunities for optimization.",

MDMP utilises a directives based approach to enable users to specify what communications should take place in the code, and then implements those communications for the user in an optimal manner using both the information provided by the user and data collected from instrumenting the code and gathering information on the data to be communicated.

It is parallelised using MPI with the simulation domain decomposed across tasks. The optimal domain decomposition is non-trivial, and complicated by the different requirements of the linear and non-linear parts of the calculations. GS2 users currently choose a data layout, and are guided towards processor counts that are efficient for linear calculations. These choices can, however, lead to data decompositions that are relatively inefficient for the non-linear calculations. We have analysed the performance impact of the data decompositions on the non-linear calculation, and the communications required for those calculations. This has helped us to optimise the decomposition algorithm by using slightly imbalanced data layouts for the non-linear calculations whilst maintaining the existing decompositions for the linear calculations. With the imbalanced layouts we completely eliminate communications for parts of the non-linear simulation.",

        "abstract": "OpenACC is a relatively new standard, first released in November 2011, which brings directives-based programming to accelerators such as NVidia or AMD GPUs, Intel MICs or other devices which can accelerate computational kernels. The use of accelerators as part of a heterogeneous multi-core system is one likely path towards exa-scale technologies. Programming models for such systems are highly likely to be directives-based as programmers will expect systems tools and compilers to make sensible choices about when and where to offload certain computational kernels dependent on a knowledge of the system.In this work, we present a benchmark suite for OpenACC to compare systems and compilers. This suite provides three levels of benchmark ranging from low level data movement such as time taken to copy data to and from a device, through basic BLAS-type mathematical kernels such as DGEMM, ATAX and 2DCONV, to demonstration applications such as SEISMO, a 2D seismological simulation code. Each benchmark included is representative of operations commonly found in scientific computing.To demonstrate the operation of the benchmark suite, we provide results obtained from the most recently released compilers from industry (CAPS, PGI, Cray) and academia (ULL). Our results show how a programmer can make an informed choice about which compiler would give best performance on their system. Alternatively, a programmer could use a single compiler but run the benchmarks on various systems to give an idea which system will best suit their application. This latter point is especially important where a choice of hardware is available, it may not be obvious which device is the best choice for a particular application without testing a range of devices.We also envisage usage by compiler writers who can use our benchmarks to provide an independent reference source for the code they produce. Given the relative youth of the standard and implementations of that standard, it is important for compiler writers to be able to benchmark their compilers using externally provided codes.",

They are then taken through the process of analyzing customer data to predict whether and when customers may move to a new service provider-a phenomenon known as customer \"churn\". An example in this chapter shows how data can be used to understand how best to offer existing customers complementary services. The chapter offers some thoughts on the effective exploitation of data-intensive methods for business intelligence in a production capacity, including considerations of problem scale.

        "abstract": "We will present an analysis of 3D FFT methods scaling from matrices of 1283 to 10243. We will show how the performance is limited by the memory, so larger systems can only be on multiple nodes, necessitating the use of network interconnect and discuss the implications of using small FFTs limited to single nodes and the associated profitability of performing the same calculation multiple times to avoid network communication. This will be of particular importance to GPU implementations of software packages in order to reduce the requirement of moving data on and off GPU accelerators.We will discuss our investigation into the optimal construction of 3D FFTs by using either a 3D FFT library function call or using multiple 1D FFTs. We will also consider the equivalent GPU directives by using cu-FFT library calls. Critically, the performance of 3D FFTs relies heavily on the performance of the all-to-all communications of a particular architecture.Finally we will discuss a case study of FFT performance in CASTEP, in its current format and also by using data replication to reduce communication of FFT routines across nodes. Performance can be boosted by distributing small FFT calculations on processes (16 cores on HECToR), then nodes (two processes, with a total of 32 cores) and finally by blades (4 nodes with 128 cores). We discuss the benefits for various simulations in CASTEP of using fewer processes and minimising the use of the interconnect of HECToR.",

The Robust Application Porting for HPC in the Cloud (RAPPORT) project took advantage of existing links between computing researchers and application scientists in the fields of bioinformatics, high-energy physics (HEP) and digital humanities, to investigate running a set of scientific HPC applications from these domains on cloud infrastructure. In this paper, we focus on the bioinformatics and HEP domains, describing the applications and target cloud platforms. We conclude that, while there are many factors that need consideration, there is no fundamental impediment to the use of cloud infrastructure for running many types of HPC applications and, in some cases, there is potential for researchers to benefit significantly from the flexibility offered by cloud platforms.",

        "abstract": "Iterative methods for solving large sparse systems of linear equations are widely used in many HPC applications. Extreme scaling of these methods can be difficult, however, since global synchronisation to form dot products is typically required at every iteration.To try to overcome this limitation we propose a hybrid approach, where the solution space is partitioned up into blocks. The solving of these blocks occurs at two levels; interblock communication is performed synchronously and intrablock asynchronously. Following this approach it is possible to completely separate the concerns involved at the block and intra block level, allowing one to choose a highly optimised (parallel) internal block solver and an asynchronous method operating at the global level. Using this approach one can achieve extreme scalability - when the limits of conventional solvers start to be reached the system can be partitioned into one or more blocks, each operating with the same conventional solver but at a high level employing asynchronous block Jacobi or some other multisplitting technique.Our block framework has been built to use PETSc, a popular scientific suite for solving sparse linear systems, as the synchronous interblock solver, and we demonstrate results on up to 32768 cores of a Cray XE6 system.",

        "abstract": "The increasing number of processing elements and decreasing memory to core ratio in modern high-performance platforms makes efficient strong scaling a key requirement for numerical algorithms. In order to achieve efficient scalability on massively parallel systems scientific software must evolve across the entire stack to exploit the multiple levels of parallelism exposed in modern architectures. In this paper we demonstrate the use of hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelisation to optimise parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication in PETSc, a widely used scientific library for the scalable solution of partial differential equations. Using large matrices generated by Fluidity, an open source CFD application code which uses PETSc as its linear solver engine, we evaluate the effect of explicit communication overlap using task-based parallelism and show how to further improve performance by explicitly load balancing threads within MPI processes. We demonstrate a significant speedup over the pure-MPI mode and efficient strong scaling of sparse matrix-vector multiplication on Fujitsu PRIMEHPC FX10 and Cray XE6 systems.",

        "abstract": "The Partitioned Global Address Space memory model has been popularised by a number of languages and applications. However this abstraction can often result in the programmer having to rely on some in built choices and with this implicit parallelism, with little assistance by the programmer, the scalability and performance of the code heavily depends on the compiler and choice of application.We propose an approach, type oriented programming, where all aspects of parallelism are encoded via types and the type system. The type information associated by the programmer will determine, for instance, how an array is allocated, partitioned and distributed. With this rich, high level of information the compiler can generate an efficient target executable. If the programmer wishes to omit detailed type information then the compiler will rely on well documented and safe default behaviour which can be tuned at a later date with the addition of types. The type oriented parallel programming language Mesham, which follows the PGAS memory model, is presented. We illustrate how, if so wished, with the use of types one can tune all parameters and options associated with this PGAS model in a clean and consistent manner without rewriting large portions of code. An FFT case study is presented and considered both in terms of programmability and performance - the latter we demonstrate by a comparison with an existing FFT solver.",

Amazon's High Performance Computing (HPC) Cloud computing resources were compared to traditional HPC resources to quantify performance as well as assessing the complexity and cost of using the Cloud. Furthermore, a shared Cloud infrastructure is compared to standard desktop resources for scientific simulations. Whilst this is only a small scale evaluation these Cloud offerings, it does allow some conclusions to be drawn, particularly that the Cloud can currently not match the parallel performance of dedicated HPC machines for large scale parallel programs but can match the serial performance of standard computing resources for serial and small scale parallel programs. Also, the shared Cloud infrastructure cannot match dedicated computing resources for low level benchmarks, although for an actual scientific code, performance is comparable.",

Benchmarking of a small molecular dynamics simulation has been carried out using CP2K\u2019s existing MPI, OpenMP and mixed-mode MPI/OpenMP implementations to achieve full utilisation of the Xeon Phi\u2019s 240 virtual cores. Running on the Xeon Phi in native mode, CP2K is approximately 4x slower than utilising all 16 cores of a Xeon E5-2670 Sandy Bridge dualsocket node. Careful placement of processes and threads on the virtual cores of the Xeon Phi was found to be crucial in achieving good performance. Analysis of the benchmark results has led to the identification of a number of bottlenecks which must be resolved to achieve competitive performance on the Xeon Phi, which will be carried out as a follow on to the work reported here.",

We demonstrate that utilising non-blocking algorithms and libraries are critical to mixed-mode application so that it can achieve better parallel performance than the pure MPI version. In the matrix assembly kernels, the OpenMP parallel algorithm utilises graph colouring to identify independent sets of elements that can be assembled simultaneously with no race con- ditions. The TCMalloc are used here to tackle performance issues arising from automatic arrays memory allocations. The sparse linear systems defined by various equations are solved by using threaded PETSc and HYPRE is utilised as a threaded preconditioner through the PETSc interface. Since unstructured finite element codes are well known to be memory bound, particular attention has to be paid to ccNUMA architectures where data locality is particularly important to achieve good intra-node scaling characteristics. With mixed mode MPI/OpenMP, Fluidity-ICOM can now run well above 32K cores job, which offers Fluidity-ICOM capability to solve the \u201dgrand-challenge\u201d problems.",

        "abstract": "The difficulties posed by GPGPU programming and the need to increase productivity have guided research towards directive-based high-level programs for accelerators. This effort has led to the definition of the OpenACC industry standard. It significantly simplifies writing code for graph- ics engines leaving the programmer the opportunity to tune the application for the target hardware and input. In this paper we address the problem of choosing the best mapping of sequential OpenACC loops to the parallel thread- space for a given program and input size. We show that auto-tuning on mapping parameters can improve performance by up to 4.8x over the default chosen by a state-of-the- art compiler. To reduce the overhead of auto-tuning we introduce a search technique that exploits similarities in be- haviour across inputs using a nearest neighbour approach. This dramatically reduces the search for a good mapping (by 97% compared to random search). Finally we propose a heuristic for stopping the focused search which, averaged across 12 benchmarks and 30 input sizes each, achieves a speedup over the default of 1.26x with only 8 sampling runs.",

It also takes advantage of .Net thread support to improve intra-node latency.

This part will introduce the major concepts so that readers are equipped to discuss and steer their organization's response to the opportunities and obligations brought by the growing wealth of data. It will help readers understand the changing context brought about by advances in digital devices, digital communication, and ubiquitous computing. Chapter 1: The digital-data challenge, will help readers to understand the challenges ahead in making good use of the data and introduce ideas that will lead to helpful strategies. A global digital-data revolution is catalyzing change in the ways in which we live, work, relax, govern, and organize. This is a significant change in society, as important as the invention of printing or the industrial revolution, but more challenging because it is happening globally at lnternet speed. Becoming agile in adapting to this new world is essential.",

At the same time data collected from seismic stations must be processed comparing recorded signals with predictions. The EU-funded project VERCE ( http://verce.eu/ ) aims to enable specific seismological use-cases and, on the basis of requirements elicited from the seismology community, provide a service-oriented infrastructure to deal with such challenges. In this paper we present VERCE\u2019s architecture, in particular relating to forward and inverse modelling of Earth models and how the, largely file-based, HPC model can be combined with data streaming operations to enhance the scalability of experiments. We posit that the integration of services and HPC resources in an open, collaborative environment is an essential medium for the advancement of sciences of critical importance, such as seismology.",

        "abstract": "Whilst there have been great advances in HPC hardware and software in recent years, the languages and models that we use to program these machines have remained much more static. This is not from a lack of effort, but instead by virtue of the fact that the foundation that many programming languages are built on is not sufficient for the level of expressivity required for parallel work. The result is an implicit trade-off between programmability and performance which is made worse due to the fact that, whilst many scientific users are experts within their own fields, they are not HPC experts. Type oriented programming looks to address this by encoding the complexity of a language via the type system. Most of the language functionality is contained within a loosely coupled type library that can be flexibly used to control many aspects such as parallelism. Due to the high level nature of this approach there is much information available during compilation which can be used for optimisation and, in the absence of type information, the compiler can apply sensible default options thus supporting both the expert programmer and novice alike. We demonstrate that, at no performance or scalability penalty when running on up to 8196 cores of a Cray XE6 system, codes written in this type oriented manner provide improved programmability. The programmer is able to write simple, implicit parallel, HPC code at a high level and then explicitly tune by adding additional type information if required.",

        "abstract": "This document is the D-2 Report deliverable from the ERCPool project. The full title of the ERCPool project is \u201cPilot Project in Sharing High Performance Computing, Data Intensive Computing and Novel Computing Resources across Scottish HEIs\u201d.  For the remainder of this document the project will be referred to as ERCPool.The two major objectives of the ERCPool project are: 1.\tTo promote and investigate potential opportunities, through equipment pooling initiatives, for the sharing of Edinburgh\u2019s leading-edge high performance and novel computing systems at EPCC with other universities.2.\tTo deliver a report documenting the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of a move to a system of resource sharing, as well as looking at the potential benefits to researchers. This report will also look at the practical barriers to resource sharing and undertake a cost/benefit analysis.This document fulfils this project\u2019s second objective. The content for this document has been derived from the two major activities undertaken in ERCPool.1.\tA regional study, based on a pilot programme for resource sharing in novel computing.  This has involved opening up two state-of-the-art novel computing resources to researchers from outside Edinburgh. These are the Data Intensive Research (EDIM1) computer and EPCC\u2019s parallel GPGPU resource testbed. This has enabled the identification of some of the operational barriers to the sharing of these novel computing resources with researchers from outside the University of Edinburgh. 2.\tAn investigation into the potential for operating regional or topical HPC resources instead of each University procuring and operating its own machine. Using the researchers from SUPA (which covers all of the Physics departments in Scotland) and other disciplines, ERCPool has investigated and documented the future computing needs of researchers to determine to what extent these could be met by shared resources. It has also looked at the potential tangible benefits for research of sharing research computing resources, such as increased collaboration between institutions, better access to training and consultancy, equality of access to state of the art facilities to researchers from a wide geographical area, integration of university, topical and regional facilities into the UK HPC ecosystem. This has involved contacts with more than 40 staff from HEIs from across Scotland and resulted in three projects running on the state-of-the-art  novel computing resources opened up as part of ERCPool\u2019s pilot programme described above.Section 2 of this document therefore discusses if future computing needs as expressed by contacted IS providers and research groups can be met by resource pooling. Section 3 provides a SWOT analysis, whilst Section 4 discusses the possible cost benefits of resource sharing. Finally, Section 5 discusses the practical barriers to resource sharing and how these could be overcome.In summary, ERCPool has found that the barriers to sharing of novel and high performance computing resources can be broadly classified into four areas \u2013 access, resource management, application-related and costs. Overcoming the access related barriers is primarily about making the resource application process lightweight and timely. Regarding resource management, it must be recognised that traditional techniques such as batch systems and virtualisation are not appropriate for every circumstance. A range of possibilities needs to be provided that includes simple and flexible mechanisms that recognise, for example, that not all applications scale to hundreds or thousands of cores and so may require execution times of longer than 12 hours. Application based  training and not just software development training is required since many users do not program but instead run third-party applications, Such users need to know how to use these efficiently and to best effect. Probably the greatest barrier, however, to resource pooling is the lack of clarity around funding models and costs. Once these are better understood and clear, easy to understand, implement and monitor processes are in place then resource pooling will be far more appealing to researchers.  This, however, requires RCUK and HEIs to engage together to resolve this.",

We show that this effective viscosity, rather than being solely a property of the active fluid, is affected by the way chosen to measure it, and strongly depends on details such as the anchoring conditions at the probe surface and on both the system size and the size of the probe particle.",

This ecosystem has been built through recent leadership projects such as EGI and PRACE, combined with significant efforts on national levels. Many applications depend on legacy software that is difficult to maintain and difficult to run efficiently on current and future e-Infrastructures. There is a clear need for a coherent process and major efforts targeted towards enhancing the European software base for efficient use of European e-Infrastructures to increase the scientific output while ensuring the best value for money. The need for actions in this area has also been acknowledged globally and, e.g. in the US, significant funding programs targeting scientific software have been initiated.",

        "abstract": "Research is increasingly digital. Twenty-first century research has been characterised by the rise of digital methods, the third and fourth paradigms of science \u2013 computational simulation and data-intensive research. In their turn, these new approaches are both built on a common foundation \u2013 computer software.Yet despite this increasing reliance on software in research, professional practices for developing research software in academia lag far behind those in the commercial sector. Computational research tools are often fragile, generally not sustainable or usable beyond the lifetime of a given project, and frequently unsuitable for scrutiny. Those trained solely within academia often employ ad-hoc or casual development techniques. Institutions miss out on opportunities to increase the impact of their research by producing robust software deliverables that could be used and cited by their peers.Computational work must reflect the committed attitude of experimentalists towards caring about precise, professional, repeatable, meticulous work \u2013 no-one with the same casual attitude to experimental instrumentation as many researchers have to code would be allowed anywhere near a lab. This is striking considering how often research results now depend on software.Software engineering professionals are trained in best practices, and in the best commercial institutions follow a disciplined approach to the design, construction, testing and maintenance of software systems. Attempts to leverage these skills within academia by employing contract programmers typically fail, due to otherwise talented programmers lacking sufficient research experience and a necessary appreciation of the significant cultural differences between business and academia. Software engineers that do have research experience and good knowledge of the underlying domain are, however, in very short supply, due to the lack of appropriate institutional homes and career progression paths for their work.This paper provides a synthesis of discussions that took place during and after the 2012 Collaborations Workshop organized by the Software Sustainability Institute in Oxford, UK.",

        "abstract": "Things are moving quickly on the policy front with respect to the roads to Open Access with renewed focus on Gold Open Access. Gold OA is essentially the purchase of a service from a publisher: that the Publisher\u2019s (or Published) Final Copy is made available under specified terms of Open Access. This is in contrast to the Green Road to Open Access, which typically involves the deposit and availability of the Authors\u2019 Final Copy, by an author or an authorised agent. UK RepositoryNet+ (UKRepNet) is a JISC initiative being developed by EDINA. This is infrastructure to enable the delivery of services to universities and colleges in the UK in their work with Institutional Repositories (IRs) and the like to support Open Access (OA) and reporting arrangements for research outputs and outcomes. The focus is upon research literature as part of research output, noting the growth of the enhanced publication (i.e. the data behind the graph) and the importance of citation of data sources and instrumentation. Though Green OA is still important, the move to Gold OA is being accelerated faster than originally anticipated at the project kick-off in October 2011. Accordingly UKRepNet was given a \u2018watching brief\u2019 to monitor the significance of Gold OA in order that infrastructure being created remained relevant. What follows is report from that Watch activity, setting out the envisaged workflows, both financial and informational. The RepNet focus is on delivering a sustainable and fit for purpose repository service infrastructure. This has an emphasis on institutional repository infrastructure and therefore a focus on Green but naturally there are links to Gold, and as other service requirements emerge the service environment would need to be extensible to encompass those or to at least interoperate with them. Related to this JISC initiative & the wider OA environment ( both Gold & Green) is the work on metadata to research outputs that JISC is taking forward with publishers & RCUK: this includes RIOX, Vocabulary for OA (V4OA) & also the activity via the Open Access Implementation Group (OAIG) on APCs ( which this short report is feeding into). RIOX & V4OA constitute action with regards to the agreement on UK Repository Application Profile to include OA and Funder Metadata. The semantics of OA are being dealt with in V4OA which is a JISC action as a result resulting from the agreement to address this issue between OAIG & Publishers. This work will feed into the National Information Standards Organisation (NISO).",

        "abstract": "An increasing number of massively-parallel supercomputers are based on heterogeneous node architectures combining traditional, powerful multicore CPUs with energy-efficient GPU accelerators. Such systems offer high computational performance with modest power consumption. As the industry trend of closer integration of CPU and GPU silicon continues, these architectures are a possible template for future exascale systems. Given the longevity of large-scale parallel HPC applications, it is important that there is a mechanism for easy migration to such hybrid systems. The OpenACC programming model offers a directive-based method for porting existing codes to run on hybrid architectures. In this paper, we describe our experiences in porting the Himeno benchmark to run on the Cray XK6 hybrid supercomputer. We describe the OpenACC programming model and the changes needed in the code, both to port the functionality and to tune the performance. Despite the additional PCIe-related overheads when transferring data from one GPU to another over the Cray Gemini interconnect, we find the application gives very good performance and scales well. Of particular interest is the facility to launch OpenACC kernels and data transfers asynchronously, which speeds the Himeno benchmark by 5%\u201310%. Comparing performance with an optimised code on a similar CPU-based system (using 32 threads per node), we find the OpenACC GPU version to be just under twice the speed in a node-for-node comparison. This speed-up is limited by the computational simplicity of the Himeno benchmark and is likely to be greater for more complicated applications.",

However, publicly available models encoded in standard representations such as the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) either do not encode this input or use different mechanisms to do so, which hinders reproducibility of published results as well as model reuse. The authors describe here a numerically continuous function suitable for use in SBML for models of circadian rhythms forced by periodic light-dark cycles. The Input Signal Step Function (ISSF) is broadly applicable to encoding experimental manipulations, such as drug treatments, temperature changes, or inducible transgene expression, which may be transient, periodic, or mixed. It is highly configurable and is able to reproduce a wide range of waveforms. The authors have implemented this function in SBML and demonstrated its ability to modify the behavior of publicly available models to accurately reproduce published results. The implementation of ISSF allows standard simulation software to reproduce specialized circadian protocols, such as the phase-response curve. To facilitate the reuse of this function in public models, the authors have developed software to configure its behavior without any specialist knowledge of SBML. A community-standard approach to represent the inputs that entrain circadian clock models could particularly facilitate research in chronobiology.",

For thicker samples, the shear leads to a 'stick-slip' motion of part of the network along the vorticity direction. Blue phase I responds very differently: its defect network undergoes seemingly chaotic rearrangements under shear, irrespective of system size.",

        "abstract": "We simulate an experiment in which a colloidal probe is pulled through an active nematic fluid. We find that the drag on the particle is non-Stokesian (not proportional to its radius). Strikingly, a large enough particle in contractile fluid (such as an actomyosin gel) can show negative viscous drag in steady state: the particle moves in the opposite direction to the externally applied force. We explain this, and the qualitative trends seen in our simulations, in terms of the disruption of orientational order around the probe particle and the resulting modifications to the active stress.",

A generic methodology to investigate application performance and scaling characteristics has been defined, resulting in a detailed understanding of the performance of these applications. This methodology is transferable to other applications and systems: it is of practical value to developers and users who are aiming for optimal utilisation of HPC resources. An understanding of the performance characteristics of a range of large-scale HPC resources has been obtained using low-level synthetic benchmarks. A relatively simple, qualitative mechanism to assess and predict application performance on current and future architectures using synthetic benchmark results together with application performance analysis results is explored.",

We show that the field strength required for breakup (at fixed initial area fraction) decreases markedly with droplet size, because the forces act cumulatively, not individually, to detach the interfacial particles. The breakup mode involves the collective destabilization of a solidified particle raft occupying the lower part of the droplet, leading to a critical force per particle that scales approximately as N-1/2.",

        "abstract": "We present new radiative transfer simulations to support determination of sea surface temperature (SST) from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) imagery. The simulations are to be used within the ATSR Reprocessing for Climate project. The simulations are based on the \"Reference Forward Model\" line-by-line model linked with a sea surface emissivity model that accounts for wind speed and temperature, and with a discrete ordinates scattering model (DISORT). Input to the forward model is a revised atmospheric profile dataset, based on full resolution ERA-40, with a wider range of high-latitude profiles to address known retrieval biases in those regions. Analysis of the radiative impacts of atmospheric trace gases shows that geographical and temporal variation of N2O, CH4, HNO3. and CFC-11 and CFC-12 have effects of order 0.05, 0.2, 0.1 K on the 3.7, 11, 12 mu m channels respectively. In addition several trace gases, neglected in previous studies, are included using fixed profiles contributing similar to 0.04 K to top-of-atmosphere BTs. Comparison against observations for ATSR2 and AATSR indicates that forward model biases have been reduced from 0.2 to 0.5 K for previous simulations to similar to 0.1 K. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, as those data sets of interest continue to increase in size, GCTA becomes increasingly computationally prohibitive. We present an adapted version, Advanced Complex Trait Analysis (ACTA), demonstrating dramatically improved performance. RESULTS: We restructure the GRM estimation phase of the code and introduce the highly optimized parallel BLAS library combined with manual parallelization and optimization. We introduce the LAPACK library into the REML analysis stage. For a testcase with 8999 individuals and 279,435 SNPs we reduce the total runtime, using a compute node with 2 multi-core Intel Nehalem CPUs, from around 17 hours to around 11 minutes.

The model is derived using fluxes and winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) NWP model and SSTs from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). In the model, diurnal warming has a linear dependence on the net surface heat flux integrated since (approximately) dawn and an inverse quadratic dependence on the maximum of the surface wind speed in the same period. The model coefficients are found by matching, for a given integrated heat flux, the frequency distributions of the maximum wind speed and the observed warming. Diurnal cooling, where it occurs, is modelled as proportional to the integrated heat flux divided by the heat capacity of the seasonal mixed layer. The model reproduces the statistics (mean, standard deviation, and 95-percentile) of the diurnal variation of SST seen by SEVIRI and reproduces the geographical pattern of mean warming seen by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). We use the functional dependencies in the statistical model to test the behaviour of two physical model of diurnal warming that display contrasting systematic errors.",

        "abstract": "A new global two-fluid electromagnetic turbulence code, CENTORI, has been developed for the purpose of studying magnetically-confined fusion plasmas on energy confinement timescales. This code is used to evolve the combined system of electron and ion fluid equations and Maxwell equations in toroidal configurations with axisymmetric equilibria. Uniquely, the equilibrium is co-evolved with the turbulence, and is thus modified by it. CENTORI is applicable to tokamaks of arbitrary aspect ratio and high plasma beta. A predictor\u2013corrector, semi-implicit finite difference scheme is used to compute the time evolution of fluid quantities and fields. Vector operations and the evaluation of flux surface averages are speeded up by choosing the Jacobian of the transformation from laboratory to plasma coordinates to be a function of the equilibrium poloidal magnetic flux. A subroutine, GRASS, is used to co-evolve the plasma equilibrium by computing the steady-state solutions of a diffusion equation with a pseudo-time derivative. The code is written in Fortran 95 and is efficiently parallelised using Message Passing Interface (MPI). Illustrative examples of output from simulations of a tearing mode in a large aspect ratio tokamak plasma and of turbulence in an elongated conventional aspect ratio tokamak plasma are provided.",

A key challenge in digital preservation is being able to articulate, and ideally prove, the need for preservation. The Software Sustainability Institute in partnership with Curtis+Cartwright Consulting have published a series of outputs to support the sector by raising awareness of software sustainability and preservation issues. This chapter summarises some of the advice set out in the Software Preservation Benefits Framework that has been developed which can help groups understand and gauge the benefits or drawbacks of allocating effort to ensuring that preservation measures are built into processes and to promote actively preserving legacy software. This identifies four key purposes, and seven different approaches, to preserving software. In this way, important software can be preserved for future generations.",

NVIDIA CUDA is introduced into the existing C/MPI framework, and we have given careful consideration to maintainability in addition to performance. Significant performance gains are realised on each GPU through restructuring of the data layout to allow memory coalescing and the adaptation of key loops to reduce off-chip memory accesses. The halo-swap communication phase has been designed to efficiently utilise many GPUs in parallel: included is the overlapping of several stages using CUDA stream functionality. The new GPU adaptation is seen to retain the good scaling behaviour of the original CPU code, and scales well up to 256 NVIDIA Fermi GPUs (the largest resource tested). The performance on the NVIDIA Fermi GPU is observed to be up to a factor of 4 greater than the (12-core) AMD Magny-Cours CPU (with all cores utilised) for a binary fluid benchmark.",

        "abstract": "We present large scale computer simulations of the nonlinear bulk rheology of lamellar phases (smectic liquid crystals) at moderate to large values of the shear rate (Peclet numbers 10-100), in both two and three dimensions. In two dimensions we find that modest shear rates align the system and stabilise an almost regular lamellar phase, but high shear rates induce the nucleation and proliferation of defects, which in steady state is balanced by the annihilation of defects of opposite sign. The shear rate gamma at onset of this second regime is controlled by thermodynamic and kinetic parameters; we offer a scaling analysis that relates gamma to a critical \"capillary number\" involving those variables. Within the defect proliferation regime, the defects may be partially annealed by slowly decreasing the applied shear rate; this causes marked memory effects, and history-dependent rheology. Simulations in three dimensions show instead shear-induced ordering even at the highest shear rates studied here. This suggests that g_ c shifts markedly upward on increasing dimensionality. This may in part reflect the reduced constraints on defect motion, allowing them to find and annihilate each other more easily. Residual edge defects in the 3D aligned state mostly point along the flow velocity, an orientation impossible in two dimensions.",

The effective force between the pair is attractive at short range and favors assembly of colloid dimers at specific orientations relative to the local director field. When pulled through the fluid by a constant force along the helical axis, we find that such a dimer rotates, either continuously or stepwise with phase-slip events. These cases are separated by a sharp dynamical transition and lead, respectively, to a constant or an ever-increasing phase lag between the dimer orientation and the local nematic director.",

        "abstract": "The statistical language R and its Bioconductor package are favoured by many biostatisticians for processing microarray data. The amount of data produced by some analyses has reached the limits of many common bioinformatics computing infrastructures. High Performance Computing systems offer a solution to this issue. The Simple Parallel R Interface (SPRINT) is a package that provides biostatisticians with easy access to High Performance Computing systems and allows the addition of parallelized functions to R. Previous work has established that the SPRINT implementation of an R permutation testing function has close to optimal scaling on up to 512 processors on a supercomputer. Access to supercomputers, however, is not always possible, and so the work presented here compares the performance of the SPRINT implementation on a supercomputer with benchmarks on a range of platforms including cloud resources and a common desktop machine with multiprocessing capabilities.

        "abstract": "We describe a parallelised version of the MOLDY molecular dynamics program. This Fortran code is aimed at systems which may be described by short-range potentials and specifically those which may be addressed with the embedded atom method. This includes a wide range of transition metals and alloys. MOLDY provides a range of options in terms of the molecular dynamics ensemble used and the boundary conditions which may be applied. A number of standard potentials are provided, and the modular structure of the code allows new potentials to be added easily. The code is parallelisecl using OpenMP and can therefore be run on shared memory systems, including modern multicore processors. Particular attention is paid to the updates required in the main force loop, where synchronisation is often required in OpenMP implementations of molecular dynamics. We examine the performance of the parallel code in detail and give some examples of applications to realistic problems, including the dynamic compression of copper and carbon migration in an iron-carbon alloy.Program summaryProgram title: MOLDYCatalogue identifier: AEJU_v1_0Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEJU_v1_0.htmlProgram obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

OpenMP is required for parallel executionRAM: 100 MB or moreClassification: 7.7Nature of problem: Moldy addresses the problem of many atoms (of order 106) interacting via a classical interatomic potential on a timescale of microseconds. It is designed for problems where statistics must be gathered over a number of equivalent runs, such as measuring thermodynamic properities, diffusion, radiation damage, fracture. twinning deformation, nucleation and growth of phase transitions, sputtering etc. In the vast majority of materials, the interactions are non-pairwise, and the code must be able to deal with many-body forces.Solution method: Molecular dynamics involves integrating Newton's equations of motion. MOLDY uses verlet (for good energy conservation) or predictor-corrector (for accurate trajectories) algorithms. It is parallelised using open MP. It also includes a static minimisation routine to find the lowest energy structure. Boundary conditions for surfaces, clusters, grain boundaries, thermostat (Nose), barostat (Parrinello-Rahman), and externally applied strain are provided. The initial configuration can be either a repeated unit cell or have all atoms given explictly. Initial velocities are generated internally, but it is also possible to specify the velocity of a particular atom. A wide range of interatomic force models are implemented, including embedded atom, Morse or Lennard-Jones. Thus the program is especially well suited to calculations of metals.Restrictions: The code is designed for short-ranged potentials, and there is no Ewald sum. Thus for long range interactions where all particles interact with all others, the order-N scaling will fail. Different interatomic potential forms require recompilation of the code.Additional comments: There is a set of associated open-source analysis software for postprocessing and visualisation. This includes local crystal structure recognition and identification of topological defects.Running time: A set of test modules for running time are provided. The code scales as order N. The parallelisation shows near-linear scaling with number of processors in a shared memory environment. A typical run of a few tens of nanometers for a few nanoseconds will run on a timescale of days on a multiprocessor desktop. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Of the 6621 250 mu m > 32-mJy sources in our science demonstration catalogue we find that similar to 60 per cent have counterparts brighter than r = 22.4 mag in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Applying a likelihood ratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with a reliability R > 0.8. This is approximately 37 per cent of the full 250-mu m catalogue. We have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423 reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collated from several different sources, including the GAMA survey. We estimate the completeness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and present evidence that 250-mu m-selected Herschel-ATLAS galaxies have a bimodal redshift distribution. Those with reliable optical identifications have a redshift distribution peaking at z approximate to 0.25 +/- 0.05, while submillimetre colours suggest that a significant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z > 1. We also suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Our identifications are matched to UV-NIR photometry from the GAMA survey, and these data are available as part of the Herschel-ATLAS public data release.",

Such simulation codes can require very large amounts of computational resource for realistic simulations, and therefore can benefit significantly from parallelisation. The simulation code addressed in this paper can undertake different modes of aerodynamic simulation and includes both harmonic balance and time domain solvers. These different modes have performance characteristics which can affect any potential parallelisation, as can the specifics of the problem being simulated. Therefore, three different techniques have been used for the parallelisation, shared-memory, distributed-memory, and a combination of the two\u2014a hybrid or mixed-mode parallelisation. These different techniques attempt to address the different performance requirements associated with the types of simulation the code can be used for and provide the level of computational resources required for significant simulation problems. We discuss the different parallelisations and the performance they exhibit on a range of computational resources.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between magnetized space plasmas and obstacles like comets, asteroids or planets is determined by a variety of physical processes that occur simultaneously on significantly different length and time scales. Frequently the dynamics of individual ions play a key role for the shape of the interaction region: strong velocity shear between light and heavy plasma constituents, non-Maxwellian particle distributions due to pick up and asymmetries in the magnetic field topology are crucial in determining this type of interaction. Covering these processes is beyond the scope of any Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. In order to account for these effects we have developed a new adaptive hybrid code A.I.K.E.F. (Adaptive Ion-Kinetic Electron-Fluid). The code operates on Cartesian meshes that can adapt to the physical structures in both, space and time. To the authors' knowledge, there is no other adaptive hybrid simulation code in space plasma physics to the present day. Adaptivity is implemented by means of Hybrid-Block-AMR, that is individual octs are refined rather than entire blocks, where an oct is one eighth of a block. In order to account for a reasonable number of particles in each cell, particles are refined via splitting and merging. Both procedures conserve mass, momentum and kinetic energy. The code is implemented in C++ and efficiently parallelized for distributed systems by means of the Message Passing Interface (MPI). In order to demonstrate the validity of our newly developed code we have applied it to a series of fundamental test scenarios. On the one hand we demonstrate that the dispersion relation as well as the propagation characteristics of MHD and whistler mode waves are quantitatively reproduced by our simulation code. Wave propagation remains unaffected when traveling through regions that include different refinement levels. On the other hand we verify that the results obtained on high resolution uniform meshes are identical to the results from adaptive simulations that use coarse base meshes but include various levels of refinement. A remarkable speedup could be observed: the adaptive simulations required 71 times less CPU-hours than the uniform mesh simulations. Finally, we present a first series of global, three-dimensional simulations for the interaction of Mercury with the solar wind and a real time study of Titan's plasma interaction during a magnetosheath excursion.

Our results suggest a structure for blue phase III, the blue fog, which has been the subject of a long debate in liquid crystal physics. We propose that blue phase III is an amorphous network of disclination lines, which is thermodynamically and kinetically stabilized over crystalline blue phases at intermediate chiralities. This amorphous network becomes ordered under an applied electric field, as seen in experiments.",

        "abstract": "We revisit the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with open boundaries, focussing on the recent discovery by de Gier and Essler that the model has a dynamical transition along a nontrivial line in the phase diagram. This line coincides neither with any change in the steady-state properties of the TASEP nor with the corresponding line predicted by the domain wall theory. We provide numerical evidence that the TASEP indeed has a dynamical transition along the de Gier-Essler line, finding that the most convincing evidence was obtained from the density matrix renormalization group calculations. By contrast, we find that the dynamical transition is rather difficult to see in direct Monte Carlo simulations of the TASEP. We furthermore discuss in general terms scenarios that admit a distinction between the static and dynamic phase behaviour.",

        "abstract": "The statistical language R is favoured by many biostaticians for processing microarray data. In recent times, the quantity of data that can be obtained in experiments has risen significantly, making previously fast analyses time consuming, or even not possible at all with the existing software infrastructure. High Performance Computing (HPC) systems offer a solution to these problems, but at the expense of increased complexity for the end user. The Simple Parallel R Interface (SPRINT) is a library for R that aims to reduce the complexity of using HPC systems by providing biostatisticians with drop-in parallelized replacements of existing R functions. In this paper we describe the implementation of a parallel version of the Random Forest classifier in the SPRINT library.",

        "abstract": "Parallelisation, serial optimisation, compiler tuning, and many more techniques are used to optimise and improve the performance scaling of parallel programs. One area which is frequently not optimised is file I/O. This is because it is often not considered to be key to the performance of a program and also because it is traditionally difficult to optimise and very machine specific. However, in the current era of Peta- and Exascale computing it is no longer possible to ignore I/O performance as it can significantly limit the scaling of many codes when executing on very large numbers of processors or cores. Furthermore, as producing data is the main purpose of most simulation codes any work that can be undertaken to provide improved performance of I/0 can be applicable to a very large range of simulation codes, and provide them with improved functionality (i.e. the ability to produce more data).This paper describes some of the issues surrounding I/O, the technology that is commonly deployed to provide I/O on HPC machines and the software libraries available to programmers to undertake I/O. The performance of all these aspects of I/O on a range of HPC systems were investigated by the authors and a represented in this paper to motivate the discussions in the paper.",

        "abstract": "The statistical language R and its Bioconductor package are favoured by many biostatisticians for processing microarray data. The amount of data produced by some analyses has reached the limits of many common bioinformatics computing infrastructures. High Performance Computing systems offer a solution to this issue. The Simple Parallel R Interface (SPRINT) is a package that provides biostatisticians with easy access to High Performance Computing systems and allows the addition of parallelized functions to R. Previous work has established that the SPRINT implementation of an R permutation testing function has close to optimal scaling on up to 512 processors on a supercomputer. Access to supercomputers, however, is not always possible, and so the work presented here compares the performance of the SPRINT implementation on a supercomputer with benchmarks on a range of platforms including cloud resources and a common desktop machine with multiprocessing capabilities.

This involves working with a wide range of codes to try and address any performance and scaling issues that these codes have. However, as no two simulation codes are exactly the same, it is very hard to apply exactly the same approach to optimising a disparate range of codes. Indeed, the codes investigated range in terms of performance and ability from well-optimised, highly parallelised codes, to serial or poorly performing codes. After analysing, optimising, and parallelising a range of codes it is, actually, possible to discern a number of distinct optimisation techniques or approaches/strategies that can be used to improve the performance or scaling of a parallel simulation code. This paper outlines the distinct approaches that we have identified, highlighting their benefits and drawbacks, giving an overview of the type of work that is often attempted for fusion simulation code optimisation. performing codes.

The required performance is achieved by integrating and optimizing load balancing and parallel I/O, which lead to strongly scalable simulations up to 16,384 compute cores. This degree of parallelization enables computer simulations of human cardiac electrophysiology at 240 times slower than real time and activation times can be simulated in approximately 1\u2009min. This unprecedented speed suffices requirements for introducing in silico experimentation into a clinical workflow.",

        "abstract": "BioDare, an integrated data analysis and sharing resource for dynamic biological systems, by Zielinski, Moore, Troup, Beaton, Adams, Halliday, Millar.2016 overview: BioDare returns immediate value to any user who uploads data, directly justifying the time that they spend in describing and organising their data. This makes BioDare unusual among biological data management systems. It is entirely typical that this immediate value is highly targeted, to users who require specialised analysis of rhythmic data. In addition, it facilitates data sharing and public dissemination, which give value in the much longer term. 2011 summary: BioDare, was developed to store, share and analyse rhythmic time series data. Currently it stores more than 70000 time series with over 9 million time points. The repository supports the description and processing of data from various experimental techniques, as well as literature data. It allows searching and aggregation of data from independent experiments and subsequent visualisation of not only original data but also processed data (averaged, normalized, detrended). BioDare also performs data analysis by executing period analysis routines via web services, including FFT-NLLS, mFourfit and the ROBuST spectrum resampling method. BioDare was designed initially to support the ROBuST project [opening to ROBuST users in 2009], and was extended for SynthSys and TiMet projects. It is highly relevant to other similar research, worldwide. The data infrastructure team is following a staged process to open the data repository and associated web services for analysis of rhythmic data to external users. Six potential beta-testing locations were recruited and visited in Jan-Feb 2011. Requirements specified by these betatesters have been progressively included in the system, in some cases over multiple rounds of interaction. Further beta-test users were recruited in the summer of 2011. We expect to open the system to additional users in the Spring of 2012, and to make the system public within the year.2016 update. BioDare was made public as proposed and additional external users were recruited at scientific conferences in 2012-2014, including the UK circadian clock clubs, Gordon conferences on Chronobiology and GARNET data management workshops. BioDare's data analysis was transformed to support public use. First SynthSys, then in 2015 the UK Centre for Mammalian Synthetic Biology provided upgraded computer servers. Both the original analysis methods and four further rhythm analysis methods were refactored to native Java, greatly enhancing compute speed and stability, in part through a collaborative project with Edinburgh's supercomputing centre EPCC (see Zielinski et al. 2014 for detailed method evaluation and user guidance).The detailed experimental metadata required from users now supports a very powerful search method, which aggregates data from multiple labs and experiments. Data visualisation is more flexible, with many secondary data series (normalised, de-trended, averages, error bars, etc) pre-computed for rapid graphical display.Any data displayed can be downloaded as a numerical spreadsheet, to reproduce exactly the online graphs.As of February 2015, BioDare held over 41 million data points, in 232,844 timeseries, from 2,344 experiments. The 10 largest user labs were from UK, USA, Chile and Sweden. The largest single user lab by experiments works on circadian clocks in mouse cell and tissue cultures, at MRC LMB, Cambridge UK. The largest user lab by timeseries is from the original ROBuST project, working on plant circadian clocks. (see Flis et al. 2015).Partial cost recovery started in 2014: heavy users of data analysis functions pay an annual subscription. To encourage data sharing, users who release their BioDare data for public dissemination gain \"analysis credits\", which can fully support their usage costs.",

The aim of the study was to raise awareness and build capacity throughout the Further and Higher Education (FE/HE) sector to engage with preservation issues as part of the process of software development. Part of this involved examining the purpose and benefits of employing preservation measures in relation to software, both at the development stage and retrospectively to legacy software. The study built on the JISC-funded \u2018Significant Properties of Software\u2019 study that produced an excellent introduction and comprehensive framework to software preservation. This is a framework document that assists developer groups and their sponsoring bodies to understand and gauge the benefits or disbenefits of allocating effort to: \u2013 ensuring that preservation measures are built into software development processes; \u2013 actively preserving legacy software.",

The assessment of the real-life performance of HPC systems through application benchmarking is thus becoming ever more important. The Distributed European Infrastructure for Supercomputing Applications (DEISA) is an EU-funded project that tightly couples high performance computing resources in eleven supercomputing centres in Europe. In a collaboration between DEISA, Cray and IBM, this study investigates the effect of performance tuning of selected scientific applications from the DEISA Benchmark Suite on current hardware. The aim is to highlight current knowledge gaps and find the focus for training and education going forward. This includes understanding both science- and user-driven requirements for default machine configurations.",

Vertices with an arbitrary number of both background and quantum legs can be derived automatically from both gluonic and fermionic actions. The algorithm is a generalisation of our earlier algorithm based on prior work by L\\\"uscher and Weisz. We also present techniques allowing for the parallelisation of the evaluation of the often rather complex lattice Feynman rules that should allow for efficient implementation on GPUs, but also give a significant speed-up when calculating the derivatives of Feynman diagrams with respect to external momenta.",

        "abstract": "The FireGrid project aims to harness the potential of advanced forms of computation to support the response to large-scale emergencies (with an initial focus on the response to fires in the built environment). Computational models of physical phenomena are developed, and then deployed and computed on High Performance Computing resources to infer incident conditions by assimilating live sensor data from an emergency in real time or, in the case of predictive models, faster-than-real time. The results of these models are then interpreted by a knowledge-based reasoning scheme to provide decision support information in appropriate terms for the emergency responder. These models are accessed over a Grid from an agent-based system, of which the human responders form an integral part. This paper proposes a novel FireGrid architecture, and describes the rationale behind this architecture and the research results of its application to a large-scale fire experiment.

        "abstract": "We present a hybrid simulation study (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) of Titan's plasma interaction during an excursion of this moon from Saturn's magnetosphere into its magnetosheath, as observed for the first time during Cassini's T32 flyby on 13 June 2007. In contrast to earlier simulations of Titan's plasma environment under non-stationary upstream conditions, our model considers a difference in the flow directions of magnetospheric and magnetosheath plasma. Two complementary scenarios are investigated, with the flow directions of the impinging magnetospheric/magnetosheath plasmas being (A) antiparallel and (B) parallel. In both cases, our simulations show that due to the drastically reduced convection speed in the slow and dense heavy ion plasma near Titan, the satellite carries a bundle of \"fossilized\" magnetic field lines from the magnetosphere in the magnetosheath. Furthermore, the passage through Saturn's magnetopause goes along with a disruption of Titan's pick-up tail. Although the tail is not detached from the satellite, large clouds of heavy ion plasma are stripped of its outer flank, featuring a wave-like pattern. Whereas in case (B) under parallel flow conditions there is only a small retardation of about 5 min between the passage of Titan through the magnetopause and the reconfiguration of the pick-up tail, the tail reconfiguration in the case (A) scenario is completed not until 25 min after the magnetopause passage. The lifetime of fossil fields in the moon's ionosphere is approximately 25 min, regardless of whether parallel or antiparallel flow conditions are applied. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As there are few standard benchmarks written in this paradigm, it is difficult to assess the likely performance of such programs. To help address this, we examine the performance of mixed-mode OpenMP/MPI on a number of popular HPC architectures, using a synthetic benchmark suite and two large-scale applications. We find performance characteristics which differ significantly between implementations, and which highlight possible areas for improvement, especially when multiple OpenMP threads communicate simultaneously via MPI.",

Clock circuits include several light inputs and interlocked feedback loops, with complex dynamics. Multiple biological components can contribute to each part of the circuit in higher organisms. Mechanistic models with morning, evening and central feedback loops have provided a heuristic framework for the clock in plants, but were based on transcriptional control. Here, we model observed, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation and constrain many parameter values based on experimental data. The model's feedback circuit is revised and now includes PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7) and ZEITLUPE. The revised model matches data in varying environments and mutants, and gains robustness to parameter variation. Our results suggest that the activation of important morning-expressed genes follows their release from a night inhibitor (NI). Experiments inspired by the new model support the predicted NI function and show that the PRR5 gene contributes to the NI. The multiple PRR genes of Arabidopsis uncouple events in the late night from light-driven responses in the day, increasing the flexibility of rhythmic regulation.",

We present large-scale simulations of their domain growth, starting from a blue phase nucleus within a supercooled isotropic or cholesteric background. The nucleated phase is thermodynamically stable; one expects its slow orderly growth, creating a bulk cubic phase. Instead, we find that the strong propensity to form disclinations drives the rapid disorderly growth of a metastable amorphous defect network. During this process, the original nucleus is destroyed; reemergence of the stable phase may therefore require a second nucleation step. Our findings suggest that blue phases exhibit hierarchical behavior in their ordering dynamics, to match the hierarchy in their structure.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of post genomic data is increasingly becoming harder to perform on standard computing infrastructures due to the sheer amount of data involved requiring more disk space and longer processing times. High Performance Computing (HPC) is an obvious answer to the need for more computing power. Access to computer clusters is common now with HPC resources becoming available to all through local or national initiatives such as the UK supercomputing service HECToR. However, the transition from general computing, such as R Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, to parallel computing is not straight forward. Software application and tools have to be adapted to take advantage of the extra computing power. SPRINT aimsto provide bioinformaticians using R/Bioconductor to analyse microarray data with easy access to HPC providing maximum performance but requiring minimal expert knowledge and minimal changes to existing R scripts. The SPRINT framework consists of an HPC harness and a library of parallelized R functions. SPRINT is very flexible; it runs on a range of HPC systems and allows the addition of user contributed functions. It handles functions thatare trivial to parallelize, functions that are non trivial to parallelize and functions generating very large output.The SPRINT parallel harness is written in C and uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. It takes as input the R script and data to be analyzed. The use of the parallel IO support of the MPI library helps ensure that the results can be output in parallel providing great scalability. The use of ff objects from the ff package which allows the manipulation of large objects on file almost as if they were in memory, also removes the limitation on the size of the data that can be successfully analyzed. SPRINT can therefore handle very large amount of data increasing further its scalability.The SPRINT library currently includes a parallel implementation of functions that have been highlighted as bottlenecks in the analysis of post genomic data by a user requirement survey. These include a Person pair-wise correlation (cor from stats) and a permutation test function (mt.maxT from multtest). Benchmarking runs on the HECToR Cray XT system have shown an almost perfect scaling to 512 processors.",

Such structures can be formed by arrested spinodal decomposition from an initially single-phase colloidal suspension. Here, we explore by lattice Boltzmann simulation the possible effects of using magnetic colloids in bijels. This may allow additional control over the structure, during or after formation, by application of-a magnetic field or Field gradient. These effects are modest for typical parameters based on the magnetic nanoparticles used in conventional ferrofluids, although significantly larger particles might be appropriate here. Field gradient effects, which are cumulative across a sample. could then allow a route for controlled breakdown of bijels as they do for particle-stabilized droplet emulsions.",

We describe performance optimisations made to the code in several key areas, including 3D Fourier Transforms, and present the implementation of a load balancing scheme for multi-grids. These result in performance gains of around 30% on 256 cores (for a generally representative benchmark) and up to 300% on 1024 cores (for non-homogeneous systems).

The method consists in coupling a lattice Boltzmann solver for the Navier-Stokes equation to a finite difference method to solve the dynamical equations governing the evolution of the liquid crystalline order parameter. We apply this method to study the growth of cholesteric blue phase domains, within a cholesteric phase. We focus on the growth of blue phase II and on a thin slab geometry in which the domain wall is flat. Our results show that, depending on the chirality, the growing blue phase is either BPII with no or few defects, or another structure with hexagonal ordering. We hope that our simulations will spur further experimental investigations on quenches in micron-size blue phase samples. The computational size that our hybrid lattice Boltzmann scheme can handle suggests that large scale simulations of new generation of blue phase liquid crystal devices are within reach.

        "abstract": "he Integrated Tokamak Modelling Task Force (ITM-TF) is developing an infrastructure where the validation needs, as being formulated in terms of multi-device data access and detailed physics comparisons aiming for inclusion of synthetic diagnostics in the simulation chain, are key components. A device independent approach to data transport and a standardized approach to data management (data structures, naming, and access) is being developed in order to allow cross validation between different fusion devices using a single toolset. The effort is focused on ITER plasmas and ITER scenario development on current fusion device. The modeling tools are, however, aimed for general use and can be promoted in other areas of modelling as well. Extensive work has already gone into the development of standardized descriptions of the data (Consistent Physical Objects) providing initial steps towards a complete fusion modelling ontology. The longer term aim is a complete simulation platform which is expected to last and be extended in different ways for the coming 30 years. The technical underpinning is therefore of vital importance. In particular, the platform needs to be extensible and open-ended to be able to take full advantage of not only today's most advanced technologies but also be able to marshal future developments. A full level comprehensive prediction of ITER physics rapidly becomes expensive in terms of computing resources and may cover a range of computing paradigms. The simulation framework therefore needs to be able to use both grid and HPC computing facilities. Hence, data access and code coupling technologies are required to be available for a heterogeneous, possibly distributed, environment. The developments in this area are pursued in a separate project - EUFORIA (EU Fusion for ITER Applications). The current status of ITM-TF and EUFORIA is presented and discussed.",

To validate our algorithm, we study the static and the microrheology of a colloid in a nematic, with tangential anchoring of the director field at the particle surface, and we confirm theories and experiments showing that the drag force in a nematic is markedly anisotropic. We then apply our method to consider the case of a colloid inside a cholesteric, and with normal anchoring at the surface. We show that by tuning the ratio between particle size and cholesteric pitch it is possible to control the defect configuration around the particle, and to stabilise novel figure-of-eight or highly twisted loops close to the colloid surface.",

There are three supercomputer centres involved in the project located at Barcelona, Edinburgh, and Helsinki. For some of the fusion codes simply porting them to one of the supercomputers represents a major advancement in the use of the codes, as they until now have mainly been used by a small user community, or even exclusively by the author of the code. Also, where codes currently can only use one processor (i. e. are serial) providing any parallel functionality can be of major benefit to the code and the code owner(s). Many of the simulation codes for edge and core transport modelling of fusion plasma using high performance computing are estimated to currently require weeks or months of execution time to simulate science at a scale required to model the new fusion reactor ITER, and therefore these codes have to be optimised to run as fast as possible and parallelised in such a way that computer resources are used as effectively as possible. During the first fifteen month of the project, we have successfully ported eleven fusion codes to the supercomputers in Barcelona, Edinburgh and Helsinki. The installation procedure, library requirements and runtime scripts have been documented for each code, and deposited in the EUFORIA software repository and code revision system. Following this a number of these codes have been chosen for code optimisation and improvements in parallelisation and this paper outlines the experience that we have had with some of these codes, the performance improvements achieved, and the techniques used.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly. Herschel-SPIRE provides sampling of the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of type 1 and type 2 AGN, allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust (starburst) emission. We study large samples of spectroscopically confirmed type 1 and type 2 AGN lying within the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aiming to understand their FIR colour distributions and constrain their starburst contributions. We find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed AGN in the HerMES fields have 5 sigma detections at 250 mu m, in agreement with previous (sub) mm AGN studies. Their combined Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-SPIRE colours (specifically S-250/S-70 vs S-70/S-24) quite clearly separate them from the non-AGN, star forming galaxy population, as their 24 mu m flux is dominated by the hot torus emission. However, their SPIRE colours alone do not differ from those of non-AGN galaxies. SED fitting shows that all those AGN need a starburst component to fully account for their FIR emission. For objects at z > 2 we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to the starburst component, L-SB, and the AGN accretion luminosity, L-acc, with L-SB alpha L-acc(0.35). Type 2 AGN detected at 250 mu m show on average higher L-SB than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establish whether this trend indicates stronger star formation activity.",

It is hoped that next generation high performance computing (HPC) resources lead to significant reductions in execution times to leverage a new class of in-silico applications. However, peformance gains with these new platforms can only be achieved by engaging a much larger number of compute cores, necessitating strongly scalable numerical techniques. So far strong scalability has been demonstrated only for a moderate number of cores, orders of magnitude below the range required to achieve the desired performance boost.In this study, strong scalability of currently used techniques to solve the bidomain equations is investigated. Benchmark results suggest that scalability is limited to 512-4096 cores within the range of :relevant problem sizes even when systems are carefully load-balanced and advanced 10 strategies are employed.",

We provide a structural description of the system, focusing on glutamate-glutamate interactions and providing further insight into glutamate-water interactions. In particular we have characterised the solution structure using three different water potentials, finding little difference between the structural features they predict. We find key differences in the bonding motifs for the two different carboxyl groups, both in the glutamate-glutamate and glutamate-water interactions. Finally, we have examined the hydration structure of the sodium ions in the solution, showing that 10% of the ions are fully hydrated by water, despite the high glutamate concentration. ",

This paper presents a case study of the popular ocean modelling code, NEMO [1], on the HECToR system. The main aims of the study were to investigate and where possible to improve the I/O performance and nested model performance of NEMO.The paper begins with an introduction to the NEMO code along with some motivation for investigating le I/O and nested model performance. Section 3 describes the architecture of the HECToR system. Section 4 presents the baseline performance of the NEMO code and the results of a number of investigations which resulted in improved performance. In section 4.7 the effects of I/O are investigated and a method for improving the I/O performance is presented in section 5. Nested model performance is described in section 6.",

The stationary structure functions and stresses of shear-melted glass are compared quantitatively to parameter-free numerical calculations of monodisperse hard discs using mode coupling theory within the integration through transients framework. Theory qualitatively explains the properties of the yielding glass but quantitatively overestimates the shear-driven stresses and structural anisotropies.",

These patterns suggest a powerlaw rheological constitutive model for near-glass viscoelasticity, as presented here. The rheological parameters used for this model originate in the mode-coupling theory. The proposed constitutive model provides explicit expressions for the steady shear viscosity, the steady normal stress coefficient, the modulus-compliance relation, and the alpha peak of GaEuro(3). The relaxation pattern distinctly differs from gelation.",

The oscillations arise from a gradual decline of the mean price due to competition among sellers competing for the same resource. This lowers profitability and hence population but is followed by a sharp rise as speculative sellers invade the large un-inhabited areas. This cycle then begins again.",

The successful and sustainable operation of such grid infrastructures is only possible through the use of monitoring tools. The underlying networks upon which grid infrastructures are built are critical to their operation; therefore, network monitoring becomes an important part of the overall grid monitoring strategy. In this paper, the design and implementation of a set of tools for providing access to federated network monitoring data are presented, based on standards developed within the Open Grid Forum Network Measurements Working Group (NM-WG). These tools give access to data collected by heterogeneous, NM-WG compliant network monitoring tools.",

        "abstract": "We use lattice Boltzmann simulations, in conjunction with Ewald summation methods, to investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions in colloidal suspensions of dipolar particles, such as ferrofluids. Our work addresses volume fractions phi of up to 0.20 and dimensionless dipolar interaction parameters lambda of up to 8. We compare quantitatively with Brownian dynamics simulations, in which many-body hydrodynamic interactions are absent. Monte Carlo data are also used to check the accuracy of static properties measured with the lattice Boltzmann technique. At equilibrium, hydrodynamic interactions slow down both the long-time and the short-time decays of the intermediate scattering function S(q, t), for wavevectors close to the peak of the static structure factor S(q), by a factor of roughly two. The long-time slowing is diminished at high interaction strengths, whereas the short-time slowing (quantified via the hydrodynamic factor H(q)) is less affected by the dipolar interactions, despite their strong effect on the pair distribution function arising from cluster formation. Cluster formation is also studied in transient data following a quench from lambda = 0; hydrodynamic interactions slow the formation rate, again by a factor of roughly two.",

        "abstract": "The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument is a small satellite-borne radio telescope. Its purpose is to make limb-scanning measurements of atmospheric composition. One of the gases to which it is sensitive is carbon monoxide (CO), detected via the J = 2 -> 1 rotational transition at 230 GHz. CO is present in molecular gas clouds in the Milky Way. Although it was not designed for the purpose, MLS can detect emissions from galactic CO, allowing a map of the 230 GHz radio sky to be constructed. We report the MLS measurements of galactic radio emission and discuss their effect on the atmospheric mission of MLS. The region of the Milky Way with emissions strong enough to significantly affect MLS observations of atmospheric CO is identified. Ground-based radio astronomers have been mapping the sky using CO emission for many years. However, the MLS data are the first such survey to be carried out from space. The MLS survey covers a larger area of the sky than any other 230 GHz survey, but no previously unknown gas clouds are observed. (C) 2008 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Here we review some recent applications of lattice Boltzmann to study the hydrodynamics of liquid crystalline materials. In particular, we focus on the study of (a) the exotic blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals, and (b) active gels-a model system for actin plus myosin solutions or bacterial suspensions. In both cases lattice Boltzmann studies have proved useful to provide new insights into these complex materials.",

This paper presents a software implementation of the Probes Coordination Protocol (PCP) which provides a solution to this problem. The PCP allows tasks to be executed regularly on a multitude of sites without the need for repeated user or administrator intervention. In addition it provides a robust mechanism for handling site failures, and a VOMS based security model to ensure appropriate usage. The paper provides the original motivation for the PCP, describes the PCP itself and discusses the new software implementation and its application.",

The Colon Cancer Genetics Group (CCGG) at the University of Edinburgh investigates the relationship between genetic markers and colorectal cancer by using a significant part (560,000 markers, 1000 cases, 1000 controls) of the biggest genotypic data set for large bowel cancer. However, the analysis is virtually intractable for a PC-based researcher (theoretical runtime of 400 days; 3.3TB of memory and hard disk space). CCGG collaborated with EPCC, the super computing centre of the University of Edinburgh, to optimise and parallelise the analysis code. We achieved a runtime of approximately 5 hours on 512 processor cores on HECToR, the national supercomputer of the UK. The use of EPCC's skills and HPC resources has enabled CCGG to explore new territory for genetic marker analysis in colorectal cancer.",

Results showed considerable commonality of thought among the break-out groups, with 7 broad categories of response emerging. These categories were: i) There is no single common e-Infrastructure; ii) Ease of use is the initial barrier; iii) Dealing with complexity is complex; iv) Trust is important; v) Open development is necessary; vi) Give credit for digital creation; and vii) Attitudes must be changed. Within each of the categories a number of detailed points were collected. The results accord well with findings from interviews conducted by the ENGAGE project; namely that people will tend to prioritise ease of use, support and continued development over a complete feature set. This requires a sustainable community around the software and trust by the users in the e-Infrastructure providers (and vice-versa).",

        "abstract": "The Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) Half-Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES) is a major new blank-field extragalactic submillimetre (submm) survey currently underway at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Ultimately, SHADES aims to cover half a square degree at 450 and 850 \u03bcm to a 4\u03c3 depth of \u2243 8 mJy at 850 \u03bcm. Two fields are being observed, the Subaru/XMM\u2014Newton Deep Field (SXDF) (02h18m\u221205\u00b0) and the Lockman Hole East (10h52m+ 57\u00b0). The survey has three main aims: (i) to investigate the population of high-redshift submm galaxies and the cosmic history of massive dust-enshrouded star formation activity; (ii) to investigate the clustering properties of submm-selected galaxies in order to determine whether these objects could be progenitors of present-day massive ellipticals; and (iii) to investigate the fraction of submm-selected sources that harbour active galactic nuclei. To achieve these aims requires that the submm data be combined with co-spatial information spanning the radio-to-X-ray frequency range. Accordingly, SHADES has been designed to benefit from ultra-deep radio imaging obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA), deep mid-infrared observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope, submm mapping by the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (BLAST), deep near-infrared imaging with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, deep optical imaging with the Subaru Telescope and deep X-ray observations with the XMM\u2014Newton observatory. It is expected that the resulting extensive multiwavelength data set will provide complete photometric redshift information accurate to  as well as detailed spectral energy distributions for the vast majority of the submm-selected sources. In this paper, the first of a series on SHADES, we present an overview of the motivation for the survey, describe the SHADES survey strategy, provide a detailed description of the primary data-analysis pipeline and demonstrate the superiority of our adopted matched-filter source-extraction technique over, for example, Emerson-II style methods. We also report on the progress of the survey. As of 2004 February, 720 arcmin2 had been mapped with SCUBA (about 40 per cent of the anticipated final total area) to a median 1\u03c3 depth of 2.2 mJy per beam at 850 \u03bcm (25 mJy per beam at 450 \u03bcm), and the source-extraction routines give a source density of 650 \u00b1 50 sources deg\u22122 > 3\u03c3 at 850 \u03bcm. Although uncorrected for Eddington bias, this source density is more than sufficient for providing enough sources to answer the science goals of SHADES, once half a square degree is observed. A refined reanalysis of the original 8-mJy survey Lockman hole data was carried out in order to evaluate the new data-reduction pipeline. Of the 17 most secure sources in the original sample, 12 have been reconfirmed, including 10 of the 11 for which radio identifications were previously secured.",

Previous simulations for symmetric fluid quenches pointed to the formation of \"bijels\": bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels. These should be created when a glassy monolayer of particles forms at the fluid-fluid interface, arresting further demixing and rigidifying the structure. Experimental work has broadly confirmed this scenario, but it shows that bijels can also be formed in volumetrically asymmetric quenches. Here, we present new simulation results for such quenches, compare these to the symmetric case, and find a crossover to an arrested droplet phase at strong asymmetry. We then make extensive new analyses of the postarrest dynamics in our simulated bijel and droplet structures, on time scales comparable to the Brownian time for colloid motion. Our results suggest that, on these intermediate time scales, the effective activation barrier to ejection of particles from the fluid-fluid interface is smaller by at least 2 orders of magnitude than the corresponding barrier for an isolated particle on a flat interface.",

        "abstract": "The Earth Observing System (EOS) Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) aboard the Aura satellite has provided essentially daily global measurements of ozone (O-3) profiles from the upper troposphere to the upper mesosphere since August of 2004. This paper focuses on validation of the MLS stratospheric standard ozone product and its uncertainties, as obtained from the 240 GHz radiometer measurements, with a few results concerning mesospheric ozone. We compare average differences and scatter from matched MLS version 2.2 profiles and coincident ozone profiles from other satellite instruments, as well as from aircraft lidar measurements taken during Aura Validation Experiment (AVE) campaigns. Ozone comparisons are also made between MLS and balloon-borne remote and in situ sensors. We provide a detailed characterization of random and systematic uncertainties for MLS ozone. We typically find better agreement in the comparisons using MLS version 2.2 ozone than the version 1.5 data. The agreement and the MLS uncertainty estimates in the stratosphere are often of the order of 5%, with values closer to 10% (and occasionally 20%) at the lowest stratospheric altitudes, where small positive MLS biases can be found. There is very good agreement in the latitudinal distributions obtained from MLS and from coincident profiles from other satellite instruments, as well as from aircraft lidar data along the MLS track.",

We then genotyped the five highest-ranked SNPs from the joint phase 1 and 2 analysis in 14,500 cases and 13,294 controls from seven populations, and identified a previously unreported association, rs3802842 on 11q23 (OR 1.1; P=5.8 x 10(-10)),showing population differences in risk. We also replicated and fine-mapped associations at 8q24 (rs7014346; OR 1.19; P=8.6x10(-26)) and 18q21 (rs4939827; OR 1.2; P=7.8 x 10(-28)). Risk was greater for rectal than for colon cancer for rs3802842 (P < 0.008) and rs4939827 (P < 0.009). Carrying all six possible risk alleles yielded OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.75-3.89) for CRC. These findings extend our understanding of the role of common genetic variation in CRC etiology.",

        "abstract": "Ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard the Aura satellite of the NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) were experimentally added to the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) four-dimensional variational (4D-var) data assimilation system of version CY30R1, in which total ozone columns from Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) onboard the Envisat satellite and partial profiles from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV/2) instrument onboard the NOAA-16 satellite have been operationally assimilated. As shown by results for the autumn of 2005, additional constraints from MLS data significantly improved the agreement of the analyzed ozone fields with independent observations throughout most of the stratosphere, owing to the daily near-global coverage and good vertical resolution of MLS observations. The largest impacts were seen in the middle and lower stratosphere, where model deficiencies could not be effectively corrected by the operational observations without the additional information on the ozone vertical distribution provided by MLS. Even in the upper stratosphere, where ozone concentrations are mainly determined by rapid chemical processes, dense and vertically resolved MLS data helped reduce the biases related to model deficiencies. These improvements resulted in a more realistic and consistent description of spatial and temporal variations in stratospheric ozone, as demonstrated by cases in the dynamically and chemically active regions. However, combined assimilation of the often discrepant ozone observations might lead to underestimation of tropospheric ozone. In addition, model deficiencies induced large biases in the upper stratosphere in the medium-range (5-day) ozone forecasts.",

O-3 accuracy is estimated at similar to 40 ppbv + 5% (similar to 20 ppbv + 20% at 215 hPa) while the CO accuracy is estimated at similar to 30 ppbv + 30% for pressures of 147 hPa and less. Comparisons with expectations and other observations show good agreements for the O3 product, generally consistent with the systematic errors quoted above. In the case of CO, a persistent factor of similar to 2 high bias is seen at 215 hPa. However, the morphology is shown to be realistic, consistent with raw MLS radiance data, and useful for scientific study. The MLS CO data at higher altitudes are shown to be consistent with other observations.",

We use these results to develop the theory explaining both Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) and QBO driven fluctuations in tropical trace gases. For H2O, BDC variations drive part of the tropopause annual forcing through annual variations in the temperature as has been shown previously. For CO, the annual variations in the BDC amplify the annual fluctuations in CO at the tropopause as has recently been shown by Randel et al (2007). In both cases, the tropopause signal is carried upward by the mean BDC. For ozone, N2O, HCl and other gases, photochemical processes force fluctuations in the trace gases to be synchronized with annual and QBO variations in the zonal mean residual vertical velocity as is shown using lag correlations.",

The study covers April to September, 2006, over the area 11 degrees W to 17 degrees E and 35 degrees N to 57 degrees N, with 0.1 degrees cells. We use hourly satellite SSTs from which peak amplitudes of diurnal cycles in SST (dSSTs) can be estimated with error similar to 0.3 K. The diurnal excursions of SST observed are spatially and temporally coherent. The largest dSSTs exceed 6 K, affect 0.01% of the surface, and are seen in the Mediterranean, North and Irish Seas. There is an anti-correlation between the magnitude and the horizontal length scale of dSST events. Events wherein dSST exceeds 4 K have length scales of <= 40 km. From the frequency distribution of different measures of wind-speed minima, we infer that extreme dSST maxima arise where conditions of low wind speed are sustained from early morning to mid afternoon.",

In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the FireGrid project. A number of different technologies such as wireless sensor networks, grid-enabled High Performance Computing (HPC) implementation of fire models, and artificial intelligence tools need to be integrated to build up a modern fire emergency response system. We propose a system architecture that provides the framework for integration of the various technologies. We describe the components of the generic FireGrid system architecture in detail. Finally we present a small-scale demonstration experiment which has been completed to highlight the concept and application of the FireGrid system to an actual fire. Although our proposed system architecture provides a versatile framework for integration, a number of new and interesting research problems need to be solved before actual deployment of the system. We outline some of the challenges involved which require significant interdisciplinary collaborations.",

        "abstract": "CaGrid is a middleware system which combines the Grid computing, the service oriented architecture, and the model driven architecture paradigms to support development of interoperable data and analytical resources and federation of such resources in a Grid environment. The functionality provided by caGrid is an essential and integral component of the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) program. This program is established by the National Cancer Institute as a nationwide effort to develop enabling informatics technologies for collaborative, multi-institutional biomedical research with the overarching goal of accelerating translational cancer research. Although the main application domain for caGrid is cancer research, the infrastructure provides a generic framework that can be employed in other biomedical research and healthcare domains. The development of caGrid is an ongoing effort, adding new functionality and improvements based on feedback and use cases from the community. This paper provides an overview of potential future architecture and tooling directions and areas of improvement for caGrid and caGrid-like systems. This summary is based on discussions at a roadmap workshop held in February with participants from biomedical research, Grid computing, and high performance computing communities.",

        "abstract": "HECToR is the UK\u2019s new high-end computing resource available for research funded by the UK Re- search Councils. The HECToR Cray XT4 system began user service in October 2007 and comprises 5,564 dual core 2.8GHz AMD Opteron processors. The results of running a number of synthetic benchmarks and popular application codes which are used by the UK academic community are presented. The syn- thetic benchmarks include STREAMS and MPI benchmarks. The application benchmarks include fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, fusion, materials science and environmental science codes. The results are compared with those obtained on the UK\u2019s HPCx service which comprises 160 IBM e-Server p575 16- way SMP nodes each containing 8 dual core 1.5GHz IBM Power5 64-bit RISC chips. Where appropriate, results are also included from the HECToR Test and Development system which has a different memory structure from the main system. It is found that there is not much difference between the systems in terms of comparing similar numbers of processing cores, but HECToR is a much larger system with many more cores and a more scalable interconnect. Memory bandwidth is seen to be a bottleneck for certain applications on both systems, with HECToR more seriously affected.",

The reasons why such diversity exists are many: students differ widely in terms of their preparedness for study at university, their degree choice aspirations and the issue of motivation for study of a particular subject. We illustrate how well-designed e-learning course materials can support many of the particular facets of heterogeneity by offering an inherently non-linear pathway through a collection of materials, so as to offer a degree of personalisation of the learning experience.Drawing on our own experience of several years\u2019 developmentof extensive online materials to support the traditional teaching methods of a large first year physics course at the University of Edinburgh, we highlight three aspects of the design of e-learning materials that facilitate this personalisation. These are: a highly granular source of individual learning objects; online constructions (\u2018one-downs\u2019 and \u2018popups\u2019) that provide additional depth and breadth of material; and the ability to import external resources adapted to the local context.",

The analysis of the resulting data tests the limits of existing bioinformatics computing infrastructure. A solution to this issue is to use High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which contain many processors and more memory than desktop computer systems. Many biostatisticians use R to process the data gleaned from microarray analysis and there is even a dedicated group of packages, Bioconductor, for this purpose. However, to exploit HPC systems, R must be able to utilise the multiple processors available on these systems. There are existing modules that enable R to use multiple processors, but these are either difficult to use for the HPC novice or cannot be used to solve certain classes of problems. A method of exploiting HPC systems, using R, but without recourse to mastering parallel programming paradigms is therefore necessary to analyse genomic data to its fullest.",

The measurements are usable for scientific studies from the upper troposphere up to 90 km altitude. We describe these measurements and validate them by demonstrating their internal consistency and by comparing them to other remotely sounded measurements and to 2-D model simulations. Comparisons with other measurements suggest that MLS has a positive bias of 25-50% in the mesosphere and a negative bias of up to 70% in the ( almost CO-free) lower stratosphere. The geophysical features observed in the MLS CO field show excellent qualitative agreement with other measurements.",

Ozone measurements from over 60 ozonesonde stations worldwide and three lidar stations are compared with coincident MLS data. The MLS ozone stratospheric data between 150 and 3 hPa agree well with ozonesonde measurements, within 8% for the global average. MLS values at 215 hPa are biased high compared to ozonesondes by similar to 20% at middle to high latitude, although there is a lot of variability in this altitude region. Comparisons between MLS and ground-based lidar measurements from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, from the Table Mountain Facility, California, and from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France, give very good agreement, within similar to 5%, for the stratospheric values. The comparisons between MLS and the Table Mountain Facility tropospheric ozone lidar show that MLS data are biased high by similar to 30% at 215 hPa, consistent with that indicated by the ozonesonde data. We obtain better global average agreement between MLS and ozonesonde partial column values down to 215 hPa, although the average MLS values at low to middle latitudes are higher than the ozonesonde values by up to a few percent. MLS v2.2 ozone data agree better than the MLS v1.5 data with ozonesonde and lidar measurements. MLS tropical data show the wave one longitudinal pattern in the upper troposphere, with similarities to the average distribution from ozonesondes. High upper tropospheric ozone values are also observed by MLS in the tropical Pacific from June to November.",

Contrary to some theoretical scenarios, a dynamical steady state is attained with finite correlation lengths in all three spatial directions.

However, in 3D there may be a crossover to different behavior at low Reynolds number: accessing this regime requires even larger computational resources than used here.",

This peak can be related to an additional mesoscopic length scale of clusters and/or voids in the system. Simulation studies of this system have revealed that it vitrifies upon increasing the attraction into a gel-like solid at intermediate densities. The dynamics at the mesoscopic length scale corresponding to the prepeak represents the slowest mode in the system. Using mode coupling theory with all input directly taken from simulations, we reveal the mechanism for glassy arrest in the system at 40% packing fraction. The effects of the low-q peak and of polydispersity are considered in detail. We demonstrate that the local formation of physical bonds is the process whose slowing down causes arrest. It remains largely unaffected by the large-scale heterogeneities, and sets the clock for the slow cluster mode. Results from mode-coupling theory without adjustable parameters agree semiquantitatively with the local density correlators but overestimate the lifetime of the mesoscopic structure (voids).",

The model considers selling agents able to evolve their pricing strategy in competition for a fixed market. Despite its simplicity, the model displays extraordinarily rich behaviour. In addition to \"cheap\" sellers pricing to cover their costs, \"expensive\" sellers spontaneously appear to exploit short-term favourable situations. These expensive sellers \"speciate\" into discrete price bands. As well as variety in pricing strategy, the \"cheap\" sellers evolve a strongly correlated spatial structure, which in turn creates niches for their expensive competitors. Thus an entire ecosystem of coexisting, discrete, symmetry-breaking strategies arises. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2007.",

The stationary structure factor is discussed to leading orders in shear rate gamma. We find that shear affects the stationary structure whenever the dressed Peclet/Weissenberg number Pe = gamma tau becomes appreciable; here tau is the structural or alpha-relaxation time. Close to vitrification, this predicts significantly larger shear distortions than expected from considering the bare Peclet number Pe(0); it compares gamma with the diffusion time of a colloid at infinite dilution.",

        "abstract": "The wave-of-advance model was introduced to describe the spread of advantageous genes in a population. It can be adapted to model the uptake of any advantageous technology through a population, such as the arrival of neolithic farmers in Europe, the domestication of the horse, and the development of the wheel, iron tools, political organization, or advanced weaponry. Any trait that preexists alongside the advantageous one could be carried along with it, such as genetics or language, regardless of any intrinsic superiority. Decoupling of the advantageous trait from other \"hitchhiking\" traits depends on its adoption by the preexisting population. Here, we adopt a similar wave-of-advance model based on food production on a heterogeneous landscape with multiple populations. Two key results arise from geographic inhomogeneity: the \"subsistence boundary,\" land so poor that the wave of advance is halted, and the temporary \"diffusion boundary\" where the wave cannot move into poorer areas until its gradient becomes sufficiently large. At diffusion boundaries, farming technology may pass to indigenous people already in those poorer lands, allowing their population to grow and resist encroachment by farmers. Ultimately, this adoption of technology leads to the halt in spread of the hitchhiking trait and establishment of a permanent \"cultural boundary\" between distinct cultures with equivalent technology.",

        "abstract": "One of the goals of the HPC-Europa project is to provide users with a single point of access (SPA) to the resources of HPC centers in Europe. To this end, the HPC-Europa portal is being built to provide transparent, uniform, flexible and intuitive user access to HPC-Europa resources. This portal will hide the underlying complexity and heterogeneity of these resources and the services that provide access to them. Since the computational environment of HPC-Europa is strongly heterogeneous, even in terms of the deployed Grid middleware, we need a mechanism that maps a uniform graphical user interface to the functionality provided by services available in the institutions belonging to the HPC-Europa consortium. In addition, accounting information has to be stored and provided on demand for both limiting resource usage and charging purposes in the HPC-Europa infrastructure. The important goal of the SPA is also to provide the means to support user access to specific applications. This should make access to Grid infrastructures easier for end-users. Both mechanisms (generic and application-specific interfaces), along with additional tools, will combine to provide flexible and efficient software for building science gateways for researchers in various domains. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the SPA, which is based on the GridSphere portal framework. We present a mechanism for enabling end-users to transparently access services available in the HPC-Europa environment. The uniform job submission interface that uses this mechanism and is based on the Job Specification Description Language (JSDL) is presented. The mechanism supporting development of application-specific user interfaces is also described. Finally, we discuss relevant issues and interoperability problems connected with the development of the SPA, in particular those concerning job submission, security and accounting.

The original emphasis of grid computing lay in the sharing of computational resources but technological and scientific advances have led to an ongoing data explosion in many fields. How- ever, data is stored in many different storage systems and data formats, with different schema, access rights, metadata attributes, and ontologies all of which are obstacles to the access, integration and management of this information. In this chapter we examine some of the ways in which these differences can be addressed by grid technology to enable the meaningful sharing of data. In particular, we present an overview of the OGSA-DAI (Open Grid Service Ar- chitecture - Data Access and Integration) software, which provides a uniform, extensible framework for accessing structured and semi-structured data and pro- vide some examples of its use in other projects.

        "abstract": "Sensing and monitoring devices of many kinds are gradually becoming ever more pervasive in modem buildings. The range of applications is getting broader, including environmental control for occupant comfort and energy efficiency, as well as monitoring of the environment to achieve early detection and warning of emergency situations (such as fire). Conventional actuation for environmental comfort and to mitigate the effects of an emergency (such as sprinklers) is also common place. Systems for \"smart\" early response are now being developed to provide a more robust and reliable suppression or mitigation of the emergency. The FireGrid concept is about integrating the independently developing sensing technologies with modelling tools, using distributed computing (high performance computation and Grid technologies) and achieving real-time response to mitigate the potential damage as a result of major emergencies. The first application of this concept deals with fire in buildings (hence the name), however the concept is generally applicable to most emergencies. In this work the authors will discuss the basic architecture of FireGrid and how it may be used to provide early warning of the loss of structural integrity in a typical steel frame composite structure subjected to a large fire.",

Our future depends on innovationEuropean Union Regional PolicySeptember 2006.Growth in the competitiveness of economically associated but geographically distributed States such as those found within the EU, the US and across Asia, requires a balance between the natural desire to build local R&D intensity and the increasing need for infrastructure that connects with global markets - i.e. to close the gap between Business, Research and Resources (EU Regional Policy, 2006).This notion of clustering is essentially no different to Adam Smiths observations of the inter-relatedness of trades in The Wealth of Nations (1776), brought to a wider audience by Michael Porter in The Competitive Advantage of Nations (1990). Today the encouragement of cluster formation is common feature of regional policies across the globe; however, the resulting clusters often lack visibility or the critical mass required to advertise their existence and communicate their ideas to other States, let alone participate in global markets (EU, 2007).Investment in cooperative global ICT infrastructure such as the Grid offers the promise of virtualisation of processes within and between organisations that would allow local clusters to compete globally without requiring the scale or intensity implied by traditional industry development patterns.Unfortunately, the relationship between investment in ICT and the competitiveness of specific organisational processes is vexed, with Robert Solow, the Nobel Laureate in Economics, commenting in 1987 on a productivity paradox that: we see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics.The paradox was apparently resolved by Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1996), with ICT investments correlating strongly with productivity, especially where organisations were decentralised. However recent data allowing analysis of productivity before and after the investment cycles driven by Y2K and the dotcom boom and bust, have lead the respected economist Robert Gordon to defend his earlier argument that computers and the Internet have had a low impact on overall productivity (Gordon, 2000; McAfee, 2006).In such an environment, justifying investments in a global hardware and software infrastructure that provides dependable, consistent, pervasive, and inexpensive access to high-end computational capabilities (Foster and Kesselman, 1999) requires a much clearer understanding of the relationship between performance at all levels of the stack from network capability to an organisational capacity for innovation.The required technical capability is being demonstrated in multiple Grid and eScience programmes across the globe that have supported large-scale highly decentralised collaborations. These include the eVLBI collaborations in Radio- Astronomy, however as Szalay (2006) notes, such data carries little of the sensitivities associated with sharing socio-economic data, which is core to any interaction with global markets.This raises questions as to the manner in which Grid and eScience technologies may be transferred to businesses that seek to become more innovative, more competitive and hence more productive by closing the gap between Business, Research and Resources.The presentation explores this question by drawing on the experiences of having established a grid collaboratory to combine and analyse socio-economic data drawn from global markets in order to feed organisational innovation processes managed within a single secure Grid environment.This Grid first connected Curtin Business School (Western Australia) and Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (Scotland) in 2003, was extended to include the Computer Network and Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2005, and continues to develop in the light of opportunities offered by infrastructures such as TEIN2.

        "abstract": "OGSA-DAI (Open Grid Services Architecture - Data Access and Integration) provides an extensible software framework allowing data resources, such as files, relational and XML databases, to be exposed through Web services acting within collaborative Grid environments or, more modestly, in stand-alone mode. OGSA-DAI may be deployed to WSRF-based platforms, such as the Globus Toolkit 4, as well as non-WSRF based ones, such as the UK OMII Server or standard versions of Tomcat and axis. Regardless of the platform, the core functionality provided remains the same. OGSA-DAI allows data resources to be accessed and integrated into the main infrastructures presently being used to construct Grids. OGSA-DAI provides a number of optimisations that reduce unnecessary data movement by shifting work to the Web service and encapsulating multiple client-Web service interactions into a single one, and allows for functionality to be added or customised based on the application. OGSA-DAI is widely used and is available from www.ogsadai.org.uk. It is also bundled with the OMII-UK and Globus Toolkit distributions. This paper gives an overview of what OGSA-DAI is, how it works, presents some usage scenarios, and outlines future enhancements.",

        "abstract": "The DEISA Services for the Heterogeneous management Layer, better known as the DESHL, allows users and their applications to manage batch jobs and data across a computing Grid ill a uniform manner regardless of the underlying hardware and software on the various nodes. The DESHL provides a means for coordinating and integrating services for distributed resource management in a heterogeneous supercomputing environment. It provides users and their applications with a command line tool and application programming interfaces for job and data management in DEISA's UNICORE-based grid.The DESHL employs the SAGA (Simple API for Grid Applications) and JSDL (Job Submission Description Language) emerging grid standards, as well as the Open Group Batch Environment Services specification. Reliance on Grid standards will allow interoperability with other Grid environments.Three DESHL-based bash script,, have been created which demonstrate how DEISA can be exploited directly from the user's workstation. These scripts are for Task Farms, Workflows, and for Code Migration/Resubmission.",

        "abstract": "We report on a comprehensive investigation of the flow behavior of colloidal thermosensitive core-shell particles at high densities. The particles consist of a solid core of poly(styrene) onto which a network of cross-linked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) is affixed. Immersed in water the shell of these particles will swell if the temperature is low. Raising the temperature above 32 degrees C leads to a volume transition within this shell which leads to a marked shrinking of the shell. The particles have well-defined core-shell structure and a narrow size distribution. The remaining electrostatic interactions due to a small number of charges affixed to the core particles can be screened by adding 0.05M KCl to the suspensions. Below the lower critical solution temperature at 32 degrees C the particles are purely repulsive. Above this transition, a thermoreversible coagulation takes place. Lowering the temperature again leads to full dissociation of the aggregates formed by this process. The particles crystallize for effective volume fractions between 0.48 and 0.55. The crystallites can be molten by shear in order to reach a fluid sample again. The reduced shear stress measured in this metastable disordered state was found to be a unique function of the shear rate and the effective volume fraction. These reduced flow curves thus obtained can be described quantitatively by the theory of Fuchs and Cates [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 248304 (2002)] which is based on the mode-coupling theory of the glass transition.",

We compared version 1.5 level 2 data from MLS with level 2 data produced by the French data processor version 222 and 225 and by the Swedish data processor version 2.0 for several days in September 2004 and in March 2005. For the five gases studied, an overall good agreement is found between both instruments. Most of the observed discrepancies between SMR and MLS are consistent with results from other intercomparison studies involving MLS or SMR. O-3 profiles retrieved from the SMR 501.8 GHz band are noisier than MLS profiles but mean biases between both instruments do not exceed 10%. SMR HNO3 profiles are biased low relative to MLS's by similar to 30% above the profile peak. In the lower stratosphere, MLS ClO profiles are biased low by up to 0.3 ppbv relative to coincident SMR profiles, except in the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex in the presence of chlorine activation. N2O profiles from both instruments are in very good agreement with mean biases not exceeding 15%. Finally, the intercomparison between SMR and MLS CO profiles has shown a good agreement from the middle stratosphere to the middle mesosphere in spite of strong oscillations in the MLS profiles. In the upper mesosphere, MLS CO concentrations are biased high relative to SMR while negative values in the MLS retrievals are responsible for a negative bias in the tropics around 30 hPa.",

        "abstract": "Using Aura MLS data we have identified the stratospheric 'tape recorder' in carbon monoxide ( CO). Unlike the water vapor tape recorder, which is forced by the upper tropospheric seasonal variation in dehydration processes, the CO tape recorder is linked to seasonal changes in biomass burning. Since CO has a chemical lifetime of only a few months, the CO tape recorder barely extends above 20 km. The tape head for CO appears to be close to 360 K near the same location as the water vapor tape head ( Read et al., 2004). Both tape heads are below the equatorial cold point tropopause but above the base of the tropical tropopause layer. The Global Modeling Initiative chemical transport model forced by the climatology of biomass burning reproduces the CO tape recorder. The tape recorder signal in the GMI model becomes more distinct from 360 K to 380 K suggesting that convective detrainment plays a decreasingly important role with altitude.",

These global comparisons are made using long-standing global satellites and meteorological datasets, as well as some measurements from more recently launched satellites. Comparisons of MLS data with measurements from the Ft. Sumner, NM, September 2004 balloon flights are also presented. Overall, good agreement is obtained, often within 5% to 10%, but we point out certain issues to resolve and some larger systematic differences; some artifacts in the first publicly released MLS (version 1.5) dataset are noted. We comment briefly on future plans for validation and software improvements.",

        "abstract": "The human lung produces a variety of peptides and proteins which have intrinsic antimicrobial activity. In general these molecules have broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, kill micro-organisms rapidly, and evade resistance generated by pathogens. In recent years it has become increasingly apparent that the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) simultaneously possess immunomodulatory functions, suggesting complex roles for these molecules in regulating the clearance of, and immune response to, invading pathogens. These collective properties have stimulated considerable interest in the potential clinical application of endogenous AMPs. This article outlines the biology of AMPs, their pattern of expression in the lung, and their functions, with reference to both antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity. We then consider the biological importance of AMPs, before concentrating on the potential to use AMPs to therapeutic effect. The principles discussed in the article apply to innate immune defence throughout the body, but particular emphasis is placed on AMPs in the lung and the potential application to pulmonary infection.",

All measurements are made simultaneously and continuously, during both day and night. The instrument uses heterodyne radiometers that observe thermal emission from the atmospheric limb in broad spectral regions centered near 118, 190, 240, and 640 GHz, and 2.5 THz. It was launched July 15, 2004 on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Aura satellite and started full-up science operations on August 13, 2004. An atmospheric limb scan and radiometric calibration for all bands are performed routinely every 25 s. Vertical profiles are retrieved every 165 km along the suborbital track, covering 82 degrees S to 82 degrees N latitudes on each orbit. Instrument performance to date has been excellent; data have been made publicly available; and initial science results have been obtained.",

In contrast to the supercooled state, where the shear stress, sigma, tends to zero at vanishing shear rate, gamma, a stress plateau forms in the glass which extends over about two decades in shear rate. This strongly suggests the existence of a finite dynamic yield stress in the glass, sigma(+)(T)equivalent to sigma(T;gamma -> 0)> 0. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of sigma(+) suggests a yield stress discontinuity at a critical temperature of T-c=0.4 in agreement with recent mode coupling theory predictions. The corresponding qualitative change of the flow curves enables us to bracket the critical temperature T-c of the theory from above and from below. We scrutinize and support this observation by testing explicitly for the assumptions (affine flow, absence of flow-induced ordering) inherent in the theory. Furthermore, while qualitative similarity is found between the viscosity and the final relaxation time of stress fluctuations, significant quantitative differences are observed in the nonlinear regime.",

Studies have suggested that most of this transport is carried out either by tropical convection over the South Asian monsoon region or by extratropical convection over southern China. By using measurements from the newly available National Aeronautics and Space Administration Aura Microwave Limb Sounder, along with observations from the Aqua and Tropical Rainfall-Measuring Mission satellites, we establish that the TP provides the main pathway for cross-tropopause transport in this region. Tropospheric moist convection driven by elevated surface heating over the TIP is deeper and detrains more water vapor, CO, and ice at the tropopause than over the monsoon area. Warmer tropopause temperatures and slower-failing, smaller cirrus cloud particles in less saturated ambient air at the tropopause also allow more water vapor to travel into the lower stratosphere over the TP, effectively short-circuiting the slower ascent of water vapor across the cold tropical tropopause over the monsoon area. Air that is high in water vapor and CO over the Asian monsoon/TP region enters the lower stratosphere primarily over the TP, and it is then transported toward the Asian monsoon area and disperses into the large-scale upward motion of the global stratospheric circulation. Thus, hydration of the global stratosphere could be especially sensitive to changes of convection over the TP.",

These include the effect of vacuum polarization from three quark flavors: the $s$ quark and two very light flavors ($u/d$) of variable mass allowing extrapolations to the physical chiral limit. We employ Nonrelativistic QCD to simulate the $b$ quark and a highly improved staggered quark action for the light sea and valence quarks. We calculate the form factors $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ in the chiral limit for the range 16 GeV$^2 \\leq q^2 (HFAG05) of recent branching fraction data for exclusive B semileptonic decays from the BaBar, Belle and CLEO collaborations, leads to $|V_{ub}| = 4.22(30)(51) \\times 10^{-3}$. PLEASE NOTE APPENDIX B with an ERRATUM, to appear in Physical Review D, to the published version of this e-print (Phys.Rev.D 73, 074502 (2006)). Results for the form factor $f_+(q^2)$ in the chiral limit have changed significantly. The last two sentences in this abstract should now read; \"We calculate the form factor $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ in the chiral limit for the range 16 Gev$^2 \\leq q^2 10^{-3}$.",

In this paper, we present use cases for advance network resource reservation and then describe a multi-layered architecture that can support them. The architecture presents a single bandwidth broker, called BAR, which sits at the Grid layer. BAR not only provides a single point of access to Grid applications to reserve guaranteed end-to-end bandwidth, but also presents its interface in application terms (instead of networking terms). We expose two guaranteed bandwidth services: the Guaranteed Delivery File Transfer and Virtual Leased Line services. Integrated with the G\u00c9ANT2 bandwidth on demand infrastructure, our bandwidth broker deals with multiple network domains, further insulating the applications from network concerns. We also define additional components required for an end-to-end reservation as well as the interfaces between the components. Our deployed prototype demonstrated the world's first software-based, inter-domain bandwidth reservations based on Premium IP.",

Stable network connections between Australia and China were established in January 2005, allowing the extension of INWA to the network centre of the Chinese Internet at the Computer Network and Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNIC, CAS). The present collaboration with CNIC - Project INCA - focusses on innovation processes that can be supported by Grid technologies across a \u2018virtual cluster\u2019. This paper describes the current INWA infrastructure, which is migrating from 2nd to 3rd generation Grid technologies, and provides an increasingly homogeneous platform for collaboration across distinctively different socio-economic contexts. Here the focus of \u2018innovation\u2019 moves from enhancements in technical capability associated with enhanced computing and telecommunications, to their relationship with \u2018innovation capacity\u2019 \u2013 i.e. the ability to expand potential for innovation and extend an innovator\u2019s reach. To explore this relationship, we outline a framework that is being used to track the capacity of this \u2018virtual organisation\u2019 as each advance in 2nd to 3rd generation technology is implemented.",

Coarsening is markedly curtailed, and the jammed colloidal layer seemingly enters a glassy state, creating a multiply connected, solidlike film in three dimensions.

        "abstract": "We describe some scaling issues that arise when using lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods to simulate binary fluid mixtures-both in the presence and absence of colloidal particles. Two types of scaling problem arise: physical and computational. Physical scaling concerns how to relate simulation parameters to those of the real world. To do this effectively requires careful physics, because (in common with other methods) LB cannot fully resolve the hierarchy of length, energy and time-scales that arise in typical flows of complex fluids. Care is needed in deciding what physics to resolve and what to leave unresolved, particularly when colloidal particles are present in one or both of two fluid phases. This influences steering of simulation parameters such as fluid viscosity and interfacial tension. When the physics is anisotropic (for example, in systems under shear) careful adaptation of the geometry of the simulation box may be needed, an example of this, relating to our study of the effect of colloidal particles on the Rayleigh-Plateau instability of a fluid cylinder, is described. The second and closely related set of scaling issues are computational in nature: how do you scale-up simulations to very large lattice sizes? The problem is acute for system undergoing shear flow. Here one requires a set of blockwise co-moving frames to the fluid, each connected to the next by a Lees-Edwards like boundary condition. These matching planes lead to small numerical errors whose cumulative effects can become severe; strategies for minimizing such effects are discussed.",

In the second, colloids coating an interface between two fluids can inhibit the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. In the third case, capillary stresses acting at the surface of a droplet of dense colloidal suspension, surrounded by air, can explain the observed bistability between a fluid droplet and a jammed ' granule '.

Model simulations indicate the transport of boundary layer pollution by Asian summer monsoon (ASM) convection and orographic lifting to the upper troposphere over South Asia, where simulated distributions of CO resemble MLS observations. Model results also show elevated aerosols in the anticyclone region.

        "abstract": "We show results for the Upsilon spectrum calculated in lattice QCD including for the first time vacuum polarization effects for light u and d quarks as well as s quarks. We use gluon field configurations generated by the MILC collaboration. The calculations compare the results for a variety of u and d quark masses, as well as making a comparison to quenched results (in which quark vacuum polarisation is ignored) and results with only u and d quarks. The b quarks in the Upsilon are treated in lattice Nonrelativistic QCD through NLO in an expansion in the velocity of the b quark. We concentrate on accurate results for orbital and radial splittings where we see clear agreement with experiment once u, d and s quark vacuum polarisation effects are included. This now allows a consistent determination of the parameters of QCD. We demonstrate this consistency through the agreement of the Upsilon and B spectrum using the same lattice bare b quark mass. A one-loop matching to continuum QCD gives a value for the b quark mass in full lattice QCD for the first time. We obtain m_b^{\\bar{MS}}(m_b^{\\bar{MS}}) = 4.4(3) GeV. We are able to give physical results for the heavy quark potential parameters, r_0 = 0.469(7) fm and r_1 = 0.321(5) fm. Results for the fine structure in the spectrum and the Upsilon leptonic width are also presented. We predict the Upsilon - eta_b splitting to be 61(14) MeV, the Upsilon^{\\prime} - eta_b^{\\prime} splitting as 30(19) MeV and the splitting between the h_b and the spin-average of the chi_b states to be less than 6 MeV. Improvements to these calculations that will be made in the near future are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in which therapy is given while the primary tumour is still in the breast provides a highly useful model system by which to identify mechanisms associated with de novo resistance and signs of early acquired resistance. Most importantly, the model is clinically relevant. It has been confirmed that the absence of tumour oestrogen receptors confers resistance to endocrine therapy. Early changes in tumour cell proliferation following neoadjuvant treatment with the third-generation aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, do not predict accurately for subsequent clinical response. Additionally, changes in proliferation seen at later times can be the consequence of response and may be associated with early resistance. High expression of c-erbB2 does not reduce tumour responses to neoadjuvant treatment with aromatase inhibitors, but is associated with high tumour proliferation before and during treatment. It remains to be determined whether these characteristics confer subsequent resistance to treatment and early relapse in the adjuvant setting.",

As well as the predominant full-length transcript (variant 1) there also exist alternatively spliced transcripts found previously only in malignant tissue. It has been suggested that proteins encoded by these variants may interfere with normal WWOX function in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent alternate transcript demonstrated in ovarian cancer is variant 4, which lacks exons 6-8. Here, we report the first comparison of the mRNA expression of WWOX variants 1 and 4 in human ovarian tumours and normal ovaries, and correlate expression with clinical data. We demonstrate significantly lower WWOX variant 1 expression in tumours than in normal ovaries. This reduction was not associated with any specific clinical subgroup. Variant 4 was expressed at low levels, and significantly associated with high grade and advanced stage ovarian cancer. Furthermore, tumours co-expressing variant 4 and relatively high levels of variant 1 showed significantly worse survival than tumours expressing variant 1 alone. However, variant 4 was also frequently identified in non-malignant ovarian tissue. These results support the role of WWOX variant 1 as a suppressor of ovarian tumourigenesis, but the role of variant 4 remains speculative.",

        "abstract": "Marked cellular and molecular changes may occur in breast cancers following treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer patients with aromatase inhibitors. Neoadjuvant protocols, in which treatment is given with the primary tumour still within the breast, are particularly illuminating. In Edinburgh, we have shown that 3 months treatment with either anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole produces pathological responses in the majority of oestrogen receptor (ER)-rich tumours (39/59) as manifested by reduced cellularity/increased fibrosis. Changes in histological grading may also take place, most notably a reduction in mitotic figures. This probably reflects an influence on proliferation as most tumours (82%) show a marked decrease in the proliferation marker, Ki67. These effects are generally more dramatic than seen with tamoxifen given in the same setting. Differences between aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen are also apparent in changes in steroid hormone expression. Thus, immuno-staining for progesterone receptor (PgR) is reduced in almost all cases by aromatase inhibitors, becoming undetectable in many. This contrasts with effects of tamoxifen in which the most common change on PgR is to increase expression. Changes in proliferation occur rapidly following the onset of exposure to aromatase inhibitors. Thus, neoadjuvant studies with letrozole in which tumour was sampled before and after 14 days and 3 months treatment show that decreased expression of Ki67 occur at 14 days and, in many cases, the effect is greater at 14 days than 3 months. These early changes precede evidence of clinical response but do not predict for it. However, this study design has allowed RNA analysis of sequential biopsies taken during the neoadjuvant therapy. Based on clustering techniques, it has been possible to subdivide tumours into groups showing distinct patterns of molecular changes. These changes in tumour gene expression may allow definition of tumour cohorts with differing sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors and permit early recognition of response and resistance.",

        "abstract": "A new method for time-lapse signal separation and enhancement using singular-value decomposition is presented. Singular-value decomposition is used to separate a 4D signal into its constituent parts: common geology, time-lapse response and noise. Synthetic tests which demonstrate the advantages of the singular-value decomposition technique over traditional differencing methods are also presented. This signal separation and enhancement technique is used to map out both the original and moved oil-water contacts across the Nelson Field. The singular-value decomposition technique allows the oil-water contact to be mapped across regions which would have been missed using traditional differencing methods. In particular, areas toward the edges of the field are highlighted by the technique. The oil-water contact is observed to move upwards across the field, with the largest movements being associated, as anticipated, with natural production. The results obtained are broadly consistent with those predicted by the reservoir simulator model. Singular-value decomposition is demonstrated to be a useful tool for enhancing the time-lapse signal and for gaining confidence in areas where traditional differencing fails.",

        "abstract": "Initially, Grid technologies were principally associated with supercomputer centres and large-scale scientific applications in physics and astronomy. They are now increasingly seen as being relevant to many areas of e-Science and e-Business. The emergence of the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA), to complement the ongoing activity on Web Services standards, promises to provide a service-based platform that can meet the needs of both business and scientific applications. Early Grid applications focused principally on the storage, replication and movement of file-based data. Now the need for the full integration of database technologies with Grid middleware is widely recognized. Not only do many Grid applications already use databases for managing metadata, but increasingly many are associated with large databases of domain-specific information (e.g. biological or astronomical data). This paper describes the design and implementation of OGSA-DAI, a service-based architecture for database access over the Grid. The approach involves the design of Grid Data Services that allow consumers to discover the properties of structured data stores and to access their contents. The initial focus has been on support for access to Relational and XML data, but the overall architecture has been designed to be extensible to accommodate different storage paradigms. The paper describes and motivates the design decisions that have been taken, and illustrates how the approach supports a range of application scenarios. The OGSA-DAI software is freely available from http://www.ogsadai.org.uk.",

        "abstract": "One of the goals of the HPC-Europa project [1] is to provide users with a. Single Point of Access (SPA) to the resources of HPC centers in Europe. To this end, the HPC-Europa Portal is being built to provide transparent, uniform, flexible and intuitive user access to HPC-Europa resources.In this paper, we present a mechanism that enables end-users to transparently access the diverse services available in the HPC-Europa environment. The uniform job submission interface that uses this mechanism, utilizing the Job Specification Description Language (JSDL) [3], is described. We also present the architecture of the SPA, based on the GridSphere portal framework [2]. Finally, we discuss the various interoperability problems encountered, in particular those concerning job submission, security and accounting.",

We refer to such an integrated set of data resources as a virtual data warehouse. The Open Grid Services Architecture \u2013 Data Access and Integration (OGSA-DAI) project was established to produce a common middleware solution, aligned with the Global Grid Forum\u2019s (GGF) OGSA vision [OGSA] to allow uniform access to data resources using a service based architecture. In this paper the service infrastructure provided by OGSA-DAI is presented providing a snapshot of its current state, in an evolutionary process, which is attempting to build infrastructure to allow easy integration and access to distributed data using grids or web services. More information about OGSA-DAI is available from the project web site: www.ogsadai.org.",

The project has demonstrated the application of grid computing power to the analysis of distributed data drawn from collaborating companies in each time zone. This data describes regional behaviour within the \u201ce\u201d economy and provides a focus for global eSocial Science collaborations. The infrastructure supporting these interactions however is designed for eScience collaborations and hence differences with the models for global collaborative research within the social sciences, as well as regional differences in access to this infrastructure by the social science community, determine the immediate extent to which global grid technologies can support global eSocial Science. We explore this issue in an examination of the recent evolution of eScience/Grid infrastructure in China as well as broader measures relating to Internet access within China. We observe that some divergence in the uptake of access technologies is already evident within China with potential consequences for future modalities of collaborative social science research in this region.",

This report aims to discover whether this process can be optimised for aclustered architecture by collating the data from all the processors within a node into a shared memory segment and then sending all the data for one node using a single message. This planned method has the potential to decrease overheads by greatly reducing the number of messages sent, and therefore diminishing latency, of the AlltoAllv call. We compare the performance of the planned AlltoAllv with that of the standard MPI AlltoAllv on a number of clustered architectures, and find that for a standard benchmark the planned AlltoAllv can perform considerably better than the MPI version, but for a more realistic benchmark the performance benet is not as great.",

We discuss issues of metadata services in service rich environments, such as the grid. We describe the requirements and the architecture for such services in the context of grid and the available grid services. We present a data model that can capture the complexity of the data publication and discovery process. Based on that model we identify a set of interfaces and operations that need to be provided to support metadata management. We present a particular implementation of a grid metadata service, basing it on existing grid services technologies. Finally we examine alternative implementations of that service.",

Our results are: $m_s^\\msbar$(2 GeV) = 76(0)(3)(7)(0) MeV, $\\hat m^\\msbar$(2 GeV) = 2.8(0)(1)(3)(0) MeV and $m_s/\\hat m$ = 27.4(1)(4)(0)(1), where the errors are from statistics, simulation, perturbation theory, and electromagnetic effects, respectively.",

In order to evaluate the effectiveness and hence refine the e-Learning approach, it is important to understand how learners make use of the e-Learning materials and interact with the associated delivery environment. This paper presents a set of tools to track, analyse and display learners' interactions within a virtual teaming environment (VLE). The information obtained is used to derive views of the data, including coverage of the course content, information about the users of the system and routes taken through the course. These can provide a valuable input when evaluating the effectiveness of the e-Learning materials and framework. The tooling is extensible and can provide additional views of data if required. The tools are not coupled to any VLE, so can be used to supplement existing tracking data.",

        "abstract": "Capitalizing on recent advances in lattice QCD, we present a calculation of the leptonic decay constants f_{B_s} and f_{D_s} that includes effects of one strange sea quark and two light sea quarks. The discretization errors of improved staggered fermion actions are small enough to simulate with 3 dynamical flavors on lattices with spacings around 0.1 fm using present computer resources. By shedding the quenched approximation and the associated lattice scale ambiguity, lattice QCD greatly increases its predictive power. NRQCD is used to simulate heavy quarks with masses between 1.5 m_c and m_b. We arrive at the following results: f_{B_s} = 260 \\pm 7 \\pm 26 \\pm 8 \\pm 5 MeV and f_{D_s} = 290 \\pm 20 \\pm 29 \\pm 29 \\pm 6 MeV. The first quoted error is the statistical uncertainty, and the rest estimate the sizes of higher order terms neglected in this calculation. All of these uncertainties are systematically improvable by including another order in the weak coupling expansion, the nonrelativistic expansion, or the Symanzik improvement program.",

        "abstract": "Aromatase inhibition has become a major treatment strategy for postmenopausal women with oestrogen-dependent breast cancer. Its optimal application is, however, dependent upon (i) the accurate identification of cancers which are ultimately dependent upon the activity of the aromatase enzyme, (ii) the use of the best method/inhibitor by which to blockade aromatase activity. The single best predictor of response to aromatase inhibitors is the presence of tumour oestrogen receptors; receptor-negative cancers rarely respond whereas those with high levels seem particularly likely to benefit. However, there is a need for additional discriminatory markers. The use of microarray technology coupled with neoadjuvant therapy is likely to yield promising candidate genes. The finding that, amongst peripheral tissues, the tumour itself may have high activity has led to the suggestion that the tumour aromatase measurements may be predictive; however, in situ studies and the lack of robust assays for tumour aromatase suggest that tumour aromatase may not be an influential marker. Whilst drugs such as anastrozole, exemestane, formestane and letrozole are all effective and specific inhibitors of aromatase, they differ in structure, potency and mechanism of action. Thus, differential sensitivity of tissues/tumours and non-cross resistance mean inhibitors are not equivalent and individual agents may have differing roles according to the setting in which they will be used. Aromatase inhibitors have evolved as key endocrine agents in the treatment of breast cancer. They offer the promise of rational treatment management based on the accurate identification of individual cohorts of tumours responsive to specific drugs.",

It is, therefore, evident that HPCx requires effcient methods forperforming FFTs and related calculations. This study compares the performance of the two main FFT libraries on HPCx: IBM's ESSL/PESSL and FFTW. Both serial and parallel (distributed-memory only) 3D complex-to-complex FFT routines are investigated, and the performance of the two different libraries is investigated.In general, the ESSL and FFTW serial 3D FFT routines are comparable. For parallel FFTs, the PESSL library is, in general, slightly faster, however, FFTW has better parallel effciency. FFTW measured plans are extremely expensive to compute and only give a modest improvement in performance over estimated plans.Some further comments are made about the overall performance of HPCx, and its impact of the use of FFT library routines.",

The project aims to deploy an early implementation of the OGSA Data Access and Integration services (OGSA-DAI) [5] within the First South Yorkshire bus operational environment. The project has two central goals. The first is to demonstrate the deployment of OGSA-DAI services in a commercial environment, and learn from this process. The second goal is to answer specific business questions posed by First through a short data mining analysis using the OGSA-DAI service enabled data sources. The project started in May 2003 and will run through to January 2004. This paper describes the project and its current status as of August 2003.",

The applets are designed to be flexible for educators, and flexible in usage to encourage exploration and experimentation, yet are compact to minimize download time. The use of the developed environments in a practical education scenario is described, showing how the tools are used for class instruction, tutoring support, and individual learning. Subjective and qualitative evidence is presented showing that where the environments are used by students there is a discernible improvement in understanding of the concepts that the environments address. The results of this process are generalized to show the type of concept that is suitable for such treatment, and those for which improvements are not discernible.",

        "abstract": "Although much progress has been made in determining the 3-D distribution of seismic wave velocities in the Earth. substantially less is known about the 3-D distribution of intrinsic attenuation. In this study variations in attenuation and shear velocity of the Earth's mantle are constrained using measurements of differential traveltime and attenuation.The data are broad-band displacement SH seismograms filtered to have energy in the period range 8-20 s. The seismograms are obtained from over 600 globally distributed earthquakes of magnitude, M-w, 5.5 or greater.Differential traveltimes and differential t* values from multiple S phases are estimated by a waveform-fitting method, resulting in approximately 4300 measurements for SS-S in the distance range 50 degrees -105 degrees and 1000 measurements for SSS-SS in the distance range 90 degrees -179 degrees. Each measurement consists of a differential traveltime and a corresponding differential t*.The differential traveltimes and t* values are inverted to obtain models of the lateral variation of shear velocity and lateral variation of q(mu) where q(mu)=1/Q(mu) The models explain the data well but have limited depth resolution. The velocity models show good correlation with previous studies: in particular, low velocities are observed underlying mid-oceanic ridges and convergent margins and high velocities are found for continental regions. The q(mu) models show shield regions to be less attenuating than PREM, with ridges appearing as highly attenuating features. The models have limited depth resolution and to address this problem we also present a shear velocity model obtained from the combination of body wave and surface wave data sets.",

Frictional sinking is investigated using different parametrisations of the mean bottom stress in term of the mean currents. A series of model integrations shows that increasing the strength of the bottom stress allows the dense overflow to descend the continental slope at a steeper angle, as would be expected on the basis of theoretical streamtube models. The use of a linear drag, which can be thought of as parametrising unresolved time-varying motions, greatly improves the model's ability to capture a realistic dense water pathway and hence realistic CFC12 distributions.",

The first strand is to enhance the on-going studies of meteorological processes near the tropopause by using MSG cloud and profile measurements. These studies involve calculation of particle trajectories in the region of the tropical tropopause. To obtain the vertical velocities for these trajectories diabatic heating rates need to be calculated. MSG data will be used to improve the specification of cloud and water vapour fields required in these calculations. In addition the cloud fields will be used to indicate where convective mixing processes affect the trajectories.The second strand will combine high horizontal resolution MSG data with high vertical resolution EOSMLS data to improve estimates of the radiation budget. EOSMLS is an improved version of the highly successful UARSMLS instrument. UARSMLS proved successful in measuring water vapour in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. EOSMLS has been designed with greatly improved capabilities for such measurements. EOSMLS will be launched on the EOS Aura satellite in December 2002.",

        "abstract": "The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) experiments obtain measurements of atmospheric composition, temperature, and pressure by observations of millimeter- and submillimeter-wavelength thermal emission as the instrument field of view is scanned through the atmospheric limb. Features of the measurement technique include the ability to measure many atmospheric gases as well as temperature and pressure, to obtain measurements even in the presence of dense aerosol and cirrus, and to provide near-global coverage on a daily basis at all times of day and night from an orbiting platform. The composition measurements are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in atmospheric temperature. An accurate spectroscopic database is available, and the instrument calibration is also very accurate and stable. The first MLS experiment in space, launched on the (NASA) Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) in September 1991, was designed primarily to measure stratospheric profiles of ClO, O-3, H2O, and atmospheric pressure as a vertical reference. Global measurement of ClO, the predominant radical in chlorine destruction of ozone, was an especially important objective of UARS MLS. Ail objectives of UARS MLS have been accomplished and additional geophysical products beyond those for which the experiment was designed have been obtained, including measurement of upper-tropospheric water vapor, which is important for climate change studies. A follow-on MLS experiment is being developed for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and is scheduled to be launched on the EOS CHEMISTRY platform in late 2002. EOS MLS is designed for many stratospheric measurements, including HO, radicals, which could not be measured by UARS because adequate technology was not available, and better and more extensive upper-tropospheric and lower-stratospheric measurements.",

Fuzzy modelling is going to gain an increasing popularity in the GIS community, but its application find an obstacle in the high computational cost. It is possible to design efficient parallel algorithms for fuzzy modelling: here we present an approach to parallelisation of fuzzy queries for digital terrain models. Load balancing is shown to be the key point to obtain good performances, and suitable load distribution strategy is discussed.

Performance analyses on existing GIS operations, vector topology creation and interpolation, in commercial GIS products in a serial environment are used to work out the critical computational factors that determine elapsed time performance. Analyses reveal that the extraction of all data necessary to perform a GIS operation at a particular geographical locality dominates the I/O and CPU resource usage. For GIS to benefit from parallel computing, the performance of this task must be addressed.",

Different parallelisation approaches are presented and the methods developed for Cray T3D using the MPI message passing library are briefly compared to a workstation-network solution. The better results in the two environments are obtained following different strategies. The lesson learned is that MPI and other message passing libraries provide valuable help for portability, but the development of efficient and portable parallel software needs the availability of higher level approaches supporting different parallelisation strategies in a simple and effective way.",

The energy difference between the two stable conformers has been determined to be Delta W(gauche - cis) = 2.1(4) kJ mol(-1). The ground state torsional splitting for gauche CH3CH2NO has been re-evaluated as Delta E(+/-) = 153.5(4) MHz corresponding to a calculated value of the coupling constant T-be = 34.7 MHz.

        "abstract": "The microwave spectrum of gaseous nitrosoethane has been measured in the 7-40 GHz region. The monomeric vapour is shown to exist as two rotational isomers, one the cis form with a planar heavy-atom structure, the other a staggered gauche conformer. The microwave spectrum of gauche-nitrosoethane shows large centrifugal distortion shifts and additional splitting arising from tunnelling through the trans barrier. Relative intensity measurements show the cis to be more stable than the gauche form by 2.1 +/- 0.4 kJ mol-1. The dipole moments were determined through the Stark effect: mu(a) = 2.316 (2), mu(b) = 0.623 (4) and mu(t) = 2.398 (2) D (1 D almost-equal-to 3.33564 x 10(-30) C m) for the N-15 cis, and mu(a) = 2.288 (4), mu(b) = 0.814 (5), mu(c) = 0.460 (9) and mu(t) = 2.471 (4) D for the N-15 gauche form. Nitrogen-14 quadrupole coupling constants have been determined to be chi(aa) = -2.525 (56) and (chi(bb) - chi(cc)) = -7.311 (97) MHz for the cis, and (chi(bb) - chi(cc)) = 3.518 (40) MHz for the gauche conformer.Molecular structures have been calculated for both conformers on the basis of the oxygen-18, nitrogen-15 and main species data. The angle CCN angle opens up by 8-degrees on going from gauche- to cis-nitrosoethane. The barrier hindering internal rotation of the methyl group is the same for both conformers within experimental error, V3 = 10.9 +/- 0.3 kJ mol-1 for the cis form and 10.9 +/- 0.3 kJ mol-1 for the gauche conformer.",

The quantitative aspects of these previous computations are not significantly affected by the present corrections, although there are some important qualitative improvements.The revised LET theory is also extended to the problem of passive scalar convection, and numerical results have been obtained for freely decaying isotropic turbulence, with Taylor-Reynolds numbers in the range 5 less-than-or-equal-to R(lambda) less-than-or-equal-to 1060, and for Prandtl numbers of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.O. At sufficiently high values of the Reynolds number, both velocity and scalar spectra are found to exhibit Kolmogorov-type power laws, with the Kolmogorov spectral constant taking the value alpha = 2.5 and the Corrsin-Oboukhov constant taking a value of beta = 1.1.",

In spite of elaborate studies on the role of CD2 and CD2R in adhesion and stimulation of T cells in vitro, no instances of CD2R expression in vivo were known to date. We report high levels of CD2R observed on blood and synovial fluid T cells in rheumatoid arthritis and on peripheral blood T cells in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, and Lyme disease. In vivo, expression of CD2R was restricted to T cells, not limited to a particular T-cell subset and not correlated with the expression of p55 interleukin 2R (IL-2R) (CD25) or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. When stimulated to proliferation via CD2 or CD3, ex vivo CD2R+ T cells showed the same basic activation requirements as CD2R-T cells.",
